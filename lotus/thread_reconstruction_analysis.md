# Twitter Thread Reconstruction Analysis

## Comparison of Methods

### Basic Thread Reconstructor
- Found only 3 potential threads
- Each thread contained only 2 tweets
- Used simple pattern matching for thread detection

### Enhanced Thread Reconstructor
- Found 130 potential threads
- Longest thread: 12 tweets
- Average thread length: 3.2 tweets
- Thread distribution:
  - 2 tweets: 68 threads
  - 3 tweets: 28 threads
  - 4 tweets: 9 threads
  - 5 tweets: 9 threads
  - 6 tweets: 7 threads
  - 7 tweets: 4 threads
  - 9 tweets: 4 threads
  - 12 tweets: 1 thread

## Method Effectiveness

The enhanced thread reconstructor significantly outperformed the basic version by using three complementary methods:

1. **Thread detection by explicit numbering**: Identified tweets with patterns like "1/", "(1/5)", etc.
2. **Text similarity and temporal proximity**: Grouped tweets from the same author that were posted close in time and had thread markers
3. **Content-based thread detection**: Identified tweets discussing the same topic using Jaccard similarity of words

## Insights

- Twitter data from the archive lacks explicit thread structure metadata
- Reconstructing threads requires pattern matching and heuristics
- The temporal proximity of tweets is a strong indicator of thread relationships
- Thread markers such as numbering patterns are reliable signals
- Content similarity helps identify threads without explicit markers

## Next Steps

1. **Evaluate reconstructed threads**: Manually review sample threads to assess accuracy
2. **Refine detection algorithms**: Adjust thresholds for similarity and temporal proximity
3. **Add more detection methods**: Consider implementing URL/link analysis to identify thread connections
4. **Integrate with deltaload**: Add thread metadata during initial data collection
5. **Create thread visualization**: Develop a UI to browse reconstructed threads

## Conclusion

Thread reconstruction is possible even with limited metadata from Twitter archives. The enhanced methods provide a significant improvement in thread detection, though manual verification is recommended for research use cases.
