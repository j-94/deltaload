# Twitter Thread Processing PR

## Overview

This PR enhances the deltaload ETL pipeline by adding Twitter thread fetching functionality. It identifies potential Twitter threads in the bookmark data and fetches the complete thread content using the Twitter API.

## Changes

1. Added a new `thread_processor.py` module that:
   - Identifies potential Twitter threads by analyzing temporal proximity of tweets from the same author
   - Fetches complete thread data using the TwitterThreadFetcher

2. Enhanced the deltaload.py pipeline to:
   - Call the thread processor after data transformation
   - Add complete thread records to the bookmark data

3. Improved the twitter_thread_fetcher.py module to handle thread reconstruction

## Benefits

- Better data quality: Complete thread context is captured instead of individual tweets
- Improved user experience: Users can view entire Twitter threads in one record
- Enhanced analysis: Thread metadata enables more sophisticated content analysis

## Implementation Details

The thread processing follows these steps:

1. Group tweets by author
2. Find tweets that are close in time (within 60 minutes)
3. For each group of 2+ tweets, fetch the complete thread
4. Add the thread records to the bookmark data

## Testing

The PR includes full test coverage for the thread processing logic. Manual testing was performed with a sample of real Twitter threads to ensure accurate thread reconstruction.

## Future Improvements

- Add caching for thread data to minimize API calls
- Implement sentiment analysis on thread content
- Provide options for thread rendering in the UI
