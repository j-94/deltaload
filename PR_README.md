# Twitter Thread Processing PR

## Overview

This PR enhances the deltaload ETL pipeline by adding Twitter thread fetching functionality. It identifies potential Twitter threads in the bookmark data and fetches the complete thread content using the Twitter API.

## Changes

1. Added a new `thread_processor.py` module that:
   - Identifies potential Twitter threads using multiple detection methods:
     - Reply-chain analysis using `in_reply_to_status_id`
     - Temporal proximity of tweets from the same author
   - Fetches complete thread data using the TwitterThreadFetcher

2. Enhanced the deltaload.py pipeline to:
   - Call the thread processor after data transformation
   - Add complete thread records to the bookmark data

3. Improved the twitter_thread_fetcher.py module to:
   - Handle thread reconstruction
   - Implement robust rate limit handling with exponential backoff
   - Parse rate limit headers for optimal retry timing

## Benefits

- Better data quality: Complete thread context is captured instead of individual tweets
- Improved user experience: Users can view entire Twitter threads in one record
- Enhanced analysis: Thread metadata enables more sophisticated content analysis
- Robust thread detection: Using multiple detection methods increases coverage
- Resilient API usage: Rate limit handling with exponential backoff ensures reliable operation
- Production-ready: Batch processing with configurable parameters adapts to different environments

## Implementation Details

The thread processing follows these steps:

1. **Reply-chain analysis**:
   - Extract `in_reply_to_status_id` from tweet metadata
   - Build a reply graph connecting tweets in a conversation
   - Identify chains of tweets from the same author

2. **Temporal proximity analysis**:
   - Group tweets by author
   - Find tweets that are close in time (within 60 minutes)
   - Identify potential thread sequences

3. **Combined approach**:
   - Merge results from both methods while avoiding duplicates
   - For each potential thread, fetch the complete thread
   - Add the thread records to the bookmark data
   - Process in batches with configurable delays to respect API rate limits

## Testing

The PR includes full test coverage for the thread processing logic. Manual testing was performed with a sample of real Twitter threads to ensure accurate thread reconstruction.

## Future Improvements

- Add caching for thread data to minimize API calls
- Further optimize rate limit handling with shared rate limit state across requests
- Implement sentiment analysis on thread content
- Add explicit thread marker detection (1/5, 🧵, etc.)
- Provide options for thread rendering in the UI
