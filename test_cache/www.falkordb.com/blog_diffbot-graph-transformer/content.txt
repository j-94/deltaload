---------------------------------------------

Build next-generation AI applications with FalkorDB’s powerful graph database platform

LLM stuck parroting disconnected data points?

By way of design the traditional vector databases you know well, are leaving you and your team stuck. Half truths and inaccurate responses keep your application projects on hold, leading you to circle back again and again.

our GraphRAG  transforms  data into knowledge

Built on the most advanced graph database, you’ll ingest the highest volume of data and query it into a knowledge graph that gives you a higher perspective through relational **insights - in sub-milliseconds!**

The fastest way to blow your customers minds

Our state of the art technology gives you the freedom to develop applications grounded in your data. No more sweating to keep up with the standard – you set the pace of what is possible, with inbuilt GenAI capabilities previously unimaginable.

THE WONDER OF GRAPHRAG
----------------------

Ingestion

There is a better way than simply segmenting data into chunks and encoding it into ineffectual vectors.

Now you can feed high volumes of unstructured data through your database at lightening speed, unlike anything you’ve experienced before.

Brilliantly extract the relational information between your data entities, priming it for newfound contextual use.

Querying

With our GraphRAG, you can bask in enjoying immediate accuracy.

With information retrieval extracted from the connections between sub-knowledge levels, you’ll receive the most concise, relevant and contextual answer to your query every time.

Unlike vector databases who simply search for the nearest match and provide irrelevant or simply inaccurate results – not answering anything at all.

Output

Now you have the answers you’ve been waiting for.

Semantic results from vector databases that don’t get you anywhere or building much, are a thing of the past.

Now, you can simply ask your database like you would an all-knowing genie, and get something you never expected. Pulling from the accurate, relationally-rich knowledge graph, you’ll receive answers that solve your building dreams.

CODE ANALYSIS

[![Image 120: 1px transparent FalkorDB](https://www.falkordb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1px-transparent.png)](https://www.falkordb.com/use_cases/code-analysis/)

#### [Code Analysis](https://www.falkordb.com/use_cases/code-analysis/)

FalkorDB’s Graph Database excels in source code analysis by modeling relationships between code components such as classes, methods, and dependencies. It enables tracing complex code flows, identifying dependencies across modules, and visualizing the impact of changes. With graph queries, developers can efficiently navigate large codebases, detect code smells, and optimize performance bottlenecks.
