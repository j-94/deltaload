### Griptape provides clean and clear abstractions for building Gen AI Agents, Systems of Agents, Pipelines, Workflows, and RAG implementations without having to spend weeks learning Gen AI nor need to ever learn Prompt Engineering.  

Build ETL pipelines to prep your data for secure LLM access.

Compose retrieval patterns that give fast, accurate, detailed information.

Write agents, pipelines, and workflows (i.e. structures) to integrate your business logic.

üå©Ô∏è Griptape Cloud
------------------

### Skip the infrastructure management. We‚Äôll host and operate everything for you, from the data processing pipeline to the retrieval-ready database to the serverless application runtime. Simple to complex, one layer of the stack or the whole enchilada, we‚Äôve got you covered.  

Connect any data source and extract. Prep/transform it (extract, clean, chunk, embed, add metadata). Load it into a vector database index.

Generate answers, summaries, and details from your own data. Use ready-made retrieval patterns, customize them to fit your use case, or compose your own from scratch (Modular RAG).

Build your own AI agents, pipelines, and workflows. Real-time interfaces, transactional processes, batch workloads. Plug them into client applications.
