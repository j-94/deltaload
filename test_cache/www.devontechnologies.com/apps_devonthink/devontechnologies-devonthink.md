# DEVONtechnologies | DEVONthink


DEVONthink is a professional document and information management app for Mac and iOS.


## Content

Focus on your work and let DEVONthink remember all the details. Collect, organize, edit and annotate documents of any kind. Have them automatically analyzed, connected, and filed. Sync them between your Mac, iPhone, and iPad.

DEVONthink keeps all your documents in easy-to-backup databases and presents them to you in a variety of ways. Many documents can be viewed and edited without opening them in another application. Read web pages as if they were local documents.

[DEVONthink Pro](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink/editions) scans paper documents and makes them searchable, imports email, and even downloads complete web sites.

Add data of any kind, regardless of where it came from.

Don’t fight the information flood alone. Let DEVONthink for Mac _categorize documents_ based on how you filed similar documents before. Add _smart rules_ to file documents, rename them, or process them in other ways automatically.

Later retrieve the data you need using DEVONthink’s _fast and flexible search_. Find similar documents with keywords extracted from the document and the [unique See Also function](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/technology), or filter your database by dates, marks, tags, or geolocation.

_Smart groups_ present related data based on saved searches, and _reminders_ make sure you’ll not forget to work on your evil genius master plan. Add interesting materials to the _reading list_.

Organize your data with the many tools that DEVONthink provides.

Collect, analyze, summarize, write: View all your data in one place, _use tags_ to quickly organize documents, and write in editors optimized for plain text, rich text, and Markdown. _Smart templates_ are a great starting point for new documents.

Insert manual or _automatic cross-references_, add _annotations_ to any documents, and enrich your data with _custom metadata_. [Imprint PDFs and images](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink/editions) with customizable stamps and add _Bates Numbers_ to them. Two full screen modes help you stay focused.

Store your documents in _self-contained databases_ or just add references to external files. _Encrypt_ databases for maximum privacy. Clip data from other apps with a keystroke or write notes and add them to the _inbox_ to file them later. With its many extensions DEVONthink easily integrates into your workflow.

DEVONthink is open. Use, and reuse, your documents anywhere.

Add links to your documents to all apps that take [web addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL), e.g. [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/) or Apple Mail, or export your documents in their original file formats. Give your co-workers access with the built-in web interface [(Server edition only)](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink/editions). DEVONthink _never holds your data hostage_.

Sync your data between all your devices, fast and securely.

Use your databases on all your Macs, iPads, and iPhones by [synchronizing them between your devices](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink/sync). You decide what data is synced, when, and where. Strong encryption makes sure that _your data belongs to you_, not to your service provider or us.

DEVONthink To Go keeps your data at your fingertips. Literally.

Have your important documents with you all the time with _DEVONthink To Go_. Designed as a standalone app it allows you to not only view but also work with your data while you’re away from your Mac. Organize your documents, add notes, annotate PDFs, or clip data from the web. Use the fast search and predefined smart groups to quickly find what you need.

Don’t do the same thing over and over again. Automate your tasks with DEVONthink.

DEVONthink grows with your needs. Add [web feeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed) to your database to automatically import new articles, or [download and archive complete web sites](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink/editions). The [concordance](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink/editions) with its _word cloud_ gives you a real-time analysis of your data.

Flexible _smart rules_ and _reminders_ let you automate recurring tasks without being a programmer. Integrate DEVONthink with other software using _AppleScript_ and _script-driven smart templates_. The possibilities are endless.
