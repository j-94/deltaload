[\[2106.04612\] Neural Extractive Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04612)

Domain experts often need to extract structured information from large corpora. We advocate for a

search

paradigm called \`\`extractive

search

'', in which a

search

query is enriched with capture-slots, to allow for such rapid extraction. Such an extractive

search

system can be built around syntactic structures, resulting in high-precision, low-recall results. We show how the recall can be improved using neural retrieval and alignment. The goals of this paper are to concisely introduce the extractive-

search

paradigm; and to demonstrate a prototype neural retrieval system for extractive

search

and its benefits and potential. Our prototype is available at \\url{https://spike.neural-sim.apps.allenai.org/} and a video demonstration is available at \\url{https://vimeo.com/559586687}.

[\[1903.11279\] Graph Convolution for Multimodal Information Extraction from Visually Rich Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11279)

Visually rich documents (VRDs) are ubiquitous in daily business and life. Examples are purchase receipts, insurance policy documents, custom declaration forms and so on. In VRDs, visual and layout information is critical for document understanding, and texts in such documents cannot be serialized into the one-dimensional sequence without losing information. Classic information extraction models such as BiLSTM-CRF typically operate on text sequences and do not incorporate visual features. In this paper, we introduce a graph convolution based model to combine textual and visual information presented in VRDs. Graph embeddings are trained to summarize the context of a text segment in the document, and further combined with text embeddings for entity extraction. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show that our method outperforms BiLSTM-CRF baselines by significant margins, on two real-world datasets. Additionally, ablation studies are also performed to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of our model.
