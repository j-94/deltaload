People love using AITable.ai

I really love the design of AlTable.ai. It’s clean, straightforward, and user-friendly.

It’s not only easy to use but also a much more cost-effective alternative to Airtable. While there are still some areas for improvement in terms of AI capabilities, I am excited about the future developments that AItable.ai has planned on their roadmap. This tool has definitely elevated my productivity and opened up new possibilities for my projects.

**Una buona idea per analizzare i contenuti strutturati in un file excel**

La possibilità di esplorare i dati attraverso delle domande

We’ve been using their direct competitor but once we faced some issues we had to switch over to AiTable. Also, the competitor development was too slow. AiTable is excellent. Just look at their roadmap and changelog and you will see how fast they are moving forward. It helps us with projects, CRM, OKR tracking and so on. We just need more native integrations and implement more AI and it would be awesome.

**We love AITable**

The AiTable is the easiest tool to have while at work.

**Planned to use Airtable but used Aitable instead**

I am convinced that this tool can make a dent in Project Management and CRM for every solopreneurs like me. I manage a handful of people and at the same time report to my clients. Aitable got it all covered for me.

**AITable.ai Review: The top level datatable tool**

I tried a lot of Airtable-like tools before: Stackby, StartInfinity, Retable, NicoDB, Baserow and more. None of them can be compared with Airtable. They either lack many features, or just are too basic and buggy. But AITable is different. It’s truly a top level product, ready to use for enterprise users. I didn’t expect it’s already so polished and mature. The UI and product architecture are good.
