### Merchandising & Relevance tuning

Tune and boost search results to hit your KPIs via the API or no-code dashboard.

### Sub-sentence Highlighting

Search results can get long. Sub-sentence highlights show users exactly what they are looking for, quick.

----------------------------------------------------

### Built on the best foundations

We help companies build unfair competitive advantages through their search, discovery, and RAG experiences

### Private Open-Source Models

We use open source embedding models and LLMs running in our own servers. Data is never leaked.

### Batteries Included

Our API surface covers chunking, ingestion, search, recommendations, RAG, and even a little front-end.

### Self-Hostable

Sensitive data? Need maximum performance? Host Trieve yourself with terraform templates and no external dependencies.

Set up industry-leading search in 30 minutes
--------------------------------------------

Step 1: Add Existing Data

Upload individual chunks or entire documents that get chunked by our algorithms via our API or no-code dashboard.

Step 2: Integrate our API

Add calls to our API on your create and update routes to keep your data current.

Step 3: Search, Recommend, or Generate

Test and tune search, recommendations, and chat quality with our search playground, then integrate the API calls into your product.
