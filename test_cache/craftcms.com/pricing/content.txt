Pricing FAQ
-----------

###### How do I purchase Craft Pro or Craft Team? 

You can purchase Craft Pro or Craft Team by upgrading from within the app. Once you’ve downloaded Craft Solo, there will be a link at the bottom of every page in the Control Panel. This link will brings up a modal window that will walk you the whole process. If you need an alternate way to pay, please contact us, [hello@​craftcms.​com](mailto:hello@craftcms.com).

###### Can I use Craft Solo for client work? 

Technically yes, however, we don’t recommend it. Craft Solo is meant to be a solution for developers to get to know Craft and create one-off sites for themselves and their friends. We do not recommend giving admin access to non-developers and therefore strongly recommend that any professional work is done on Craft Pro or Craft Team. This ensures the best experience for everyone.

###### Can I try Craft Pro or Craft Team before buying? 

Yes, you can trial Craft Pro or Craft Team while your site is on non-public looking domain (e.g. ​“mysite.dev” or ​“stag​ing​.mysite​.com”). However, if you will need Developer Support throughout the development process we encourage you to purchase a license at the beginning of the project.

###### Are non-profit discounts available? 

Yes, we offer a flat 15% discount on Craft Pro and Craft Team for verified non-profits. Please note: The discount only applies to the license fee. We do not discount the License Update Renewal fee. Please email [hello@​craftcms.​com](mailto:hello@craftcms.com) if you’re a verified non-profit to receive this discount.

###### Will there be an upgrade fee when major Craft CMS updates come out? 

Pro and Team licenses come with one year of free License Updates. If a major edition comes out within that year, it’s included in the initial license cost. You can enable license updates for $99 per year. Please read [how license and renewals work](https://craftcms.com/knowledge-base/how-craft-licenses-and-renewals-work) for details.

###### Can I purchase an edition locally, and then transfer it to production? 

Yes you can.

###### What is Basic Developer Support? 

Basic Developer Support is for developers who need dev to dev support directly from Craft. While our community is a great resource for questions via Craft Discord, Stack Exchange, and Github, Developer Support is email-based and answered directly from a member of the Craft CMS team. For Developers working with Craft professionally and in need of guaranteed response times we recommend a [Pro or Premium Support Plan](https://craftcms.com/support-services)
