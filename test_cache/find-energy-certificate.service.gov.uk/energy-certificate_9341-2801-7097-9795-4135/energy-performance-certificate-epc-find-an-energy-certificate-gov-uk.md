Rules on letting this property
------------------------------

Properties can be let if they have an energy rating from A to E.

You can read [guidance for landlords on the regulations and exemptions](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/domestic-private-rented-property-minimum-energy-efficiency-standard-landlord-guidance).

Energy rating and score
-----------------------

This property’s energy rating is D. It has the potential to be B.

[See how to improve this property’s energy efficiency](https://find-energy-certificate.service.gov.uk/energy-certificate/9341-2801-7097-9795-4135#recommendations).

Energy efficiency chart This property’s energy rating is D with a score of 61. It has a potential energy rating of B with a score of 84. Properties get a rating from A to G and a score. Rating D is for a score of 55 to 68. The ratings and scores are as follows from best to worst. Rating A is for a score of 92 or more. Rating B is for a score of 81 to 91. Rating C is for a score of 69 to 80. Rating D is for a score of 55 to 68. Rating E is for a score of 39 to 54. Rating F is for a score of 21 to 38. Rating G is for a score of 1 to 20.The graph shows this property’s current and potential energy rating.

Properties get a rating from A (best) to G (worst) and a score. The better the rating and score, the lower your energy bills are likely to be.

For properties in England and Wales:

*   the average energy rating is D
*   the average energy score is 60

Breakdown of property’s energy performance
------------------------------------------

### Features in this property

Features get a rating from very good to very poor, based on how energy efficient they are. Ratings are not based on how well features work or their condition.

Assumed ratings are based on the property’s age and type. They are used for features the assessor could not inspect.

| Feature | Description | Rating |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wall | Solid brick, as built, no insulation (assumed) | Very poor |
| Roof | Pitched, 200 mm loft insulation | Good |
| Window | Mostly double glazing | Average |
| Main heating | Boiler and radiators, mains gas | Good |
| Main heating control | Programmer, room thermostat and TRVs | Good |
| Hot water | From main system | Good |
| Lighting | Low energy lighting in 50% of fixed outlets | Good |
| Floor | Suspended, no insulation (assumed) | N/A |
| Secondary heating | Room heaters, mains gas | N/A |

### Primary energy use

The primary energy use for this property per year is 237 kilowatt hours per square metre (kWh/m2).

About primary energy use

Primary energy use is a measure of the energy required for lighting, heating and hot water in a property. The calculation includes:

*   the efficiency of the property’s heating system
*   power station efficiency for electricity
*   the energy used to produce the fuel and deliver it to the property

How this affects your energy bills
----------------------------------

An average household would need to spend £1,096 per year on heating, hot water and lighting in this property. These costs usually make up the majority of your energy bills.

You could save £458 per year if you complete the suggested steps for improving this property’s energy rating.

This is based on average costs in 2015 when this EPC was created. People living at the property may use different amounts of energy for heating, hot water and lighting.

* * *

### Heating this property

Estimated energy needed in this property is:

*   15,467 kWh per year for heating
*   1,686 kWh per year for hot water

Impact on the environment
-------------------------

This property’s environmental impact rating is E. It has the potential to be B.

Properties get a rating from A (best) to G (worst) on how much carbon dioxide (CO2) they produce each year.

### Carbon emissions

An average household produces

6 tonnes of CO2

This property produces

4.8 tonnes of CO2

This property’s potential production

1.6 tonnes of CO2

You could improve this property’s CO2 emissions by making the suggested changes. This will help to protect the environment.

These ratings are based on assumptions about average occupancy and energy use. People living at the property may use different amounts of energy.

Steps you could take to save energy
-----------------------------------

Do I need to follow these steps in order?

Yes. Each step builds on the one before it so you can save the most energy.

For example, it’s more energy efficient to insulate your home before you buy a new boiler. A well insulated home will lose less heat so you do not have to run your boiler as often.

### About this assessment

Assessor’s declaration

No related party

Date of assessment

19 November 2015

Date of certificate

19 November 2015

Type of assessment

Show information about the RdSAP

RdSAP (Reduced data Standard Assessment Procedure) is a method used to assess and compare the energy and environmental performance of properties in the UK. It uses a site visit and survey of the property to calculate energy performance.

This type of assessment can be carried out on properties built before 1 April 2008 in England and Wales, and 30 September 2008 in Northern Ireland. It can also be used for newer properties, as long as they have a previous SAP assessment, which uses detailed information about the property’s construction to calculate energy performance.
