AI Meets Advanced Vector Search
-------------------------------

The leading open source vector database and similarity search engine designed to handle high-dimensional vectors for performance and massive-scale AI applications.

#### Cloud-Native Scalability & High-Availability

Enterprise-grade Managed Cloud. Vertical and horizontal scaling and zero-downtime upgrades.

[Qdrant Cloud](https://qdrant.tech/cloud/)

###### Ease of Use & Simple Deployment

Quick deployment in any environment with Docker and a lean API for easy integration, ideal for local testing.

[Quick Start Guide](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/quick-start/)

###### Cost Efficiency with Storage Options

Dramatically reduce memory usage with built-in compression options and offload data to disk.

[Quantization](https://qdrant.tech/articles/scalar-quantization/)

###### Rust-Powered Reliability & Performance

Purpose built in Rust for unmatched speed and reliability even when processing billions of vectors.

[Benchmarks](https://qdrant.tech/benchmarks/)

“VectorStores are definitely here to stay, the objects in the world around us from image, sound, video and text become easily universal and searchable thanks to the embedding models. I personally recommend Qdrant. We have been using it for a while and couldn't be happier.“

![Image 48: CB Insights](https://qdrant.tech/img/brands/cb-insights.svg)

“We looked at all the big options out there right now for vector databases, with our focus on ease of use, performance, pricing, and communication. **Qdrant came out on top in each category...** ultimately, it wasn't much of a contest.”
