## Content

#### What is Stremio?

Stremio is a modern media center that gives you the freedom to watch everything you want.

#### How does it work?

Once you install Stremio on your device and create an account, all you have to do is to visit the addon catalog and install any addon you want, and you're good to go!

After that, you can go to the Discover or Board sections to start exploring content.

#### What can I watch here?

A lot: Movies, TV shows, Web channels, Sport, TV channels, listen to Podcasts and more. Thanks to our addon system, you can access a variety of content.

#### Is Stremio open-source?

Yes, you can check the following links: [desktop app](https://github.com/stremio/stremio-shell) and [GitHub organization](https://github.com/Stremio).

#### Is Stremio safe?

Yes: because it is open-source software, the code is publically auditable and you can review it yourself.

Stremio's addon system was also created with the user's security in mind. The addons do not run any code locally, so they pose no risks to your device.

#### How about my privacy?

We respect users' privacy and do not collect any personal data besides the essential minimum to create and sync your account.

There is also a **Guest mode** at signup, which requires no data whatsoever: in this mode, no calls are made to our backend. However, it comes at the expense of useful features, such as being able to sync your library across devices.

#### Can I cast to my TV?

Yes, we support Chromecast and you can cast both from desktop and mobile apps (Android).

#### Can Stremio be extended beyond what's in the addon catalog?

Yes, you should check those: [PimpMyStremio](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stremio/comments/db9qmn/what_is_pimpmystremio_xpost_from_rstremioaddons/), [Reddit communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/stremioaddons), [Stremio Downloader](https://github.com/BurningSands70/stremio-downloader), etc.

#### What devices does Stremio support?

We have desktop apps for Windows, Mac and Linux. We also have dedicated apps for Android Mobile and Android TV. For iOS and iPadOS we suggest using Stremio Web, although it is more limited in functionality.

#### Can you add certain content to Stremio?

Sorry, we provide no content ourselves, but the more Stremio addons you have installed, the more content you will be able to find.

#### Can Stremio play magnet links?

Yes, and it can also play normal HTTP links and torrent files (drag and drop).

#### Can I download a video and watch offline?

Available offline is an upcoming feature, but if you allow Stremio to cache on your device (from the settings panel) you can watch the videos later without a connection.

#### Nothing works, help me!

Are you sure you have installed addons? If yes, check with our [help center](https://stremio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us).

#### How does Stremio sustain it's development operations?

We run non-intrusive ads occasionally, but we're considering moving to a donation model.
