# Introduction 

The General Permitted Development Guide (2015) is a series of Permitted Development Rights (PDRs) that allows certain work. By inclusion with the GPDO 

(Schedule), these rights are derived from a general planning permission that is permitted not by the Local Planning Authority but, at source, by 

Government. You can carry out these works without the need for a planning applicati on .

These were first introduced in 1948, when Planning came into force in the UK and contained Classes that remain today, like householder , but other specific 

Classes unique to the time , such as repla cing war destroyed buildings. The most recent, complete Legislation is 2015 . H owever, there have been several 

amendments since then , which have brought in new Classe s and disposed of some Parts. For example, Part 20 'New Dwellinghouses ' and a new Use Class 

Order , and its consummate Use Class E, on 31 Aug and 01 Sept 2020, respectively. The latter disposed of many Class 3 Change of Use PDRs because they 

referred to old Use Class , depicted on page 19. 

It is not deemed practical to cover all these 20 Classes . T herefore, this Guide will only cover Parts 1 'Householder ', 3 'Change of Use ', 14 'Renewable Energy '

and 20 'New Dwellinghouses ' because it was deemed that these C lasses would be most relevant and interesting to a Parish and Town Council audience . This 

Guide aims to explain these Classes visuall y, utilising Google SketchUp to intuitively depict the PD Right allowing the reader to visualise what PD could 

achieve. These visual isations are then annotated with their conditions. Please note, these are summarised , so please refer to the full Legislation to gain all 

the detail. For guidance on na vigating the GPDO , please view a PDF version of a presentation delivered on 14 Oct 2021 .

One such condition on certain classes of permitted development is applying to the Local Planning Authority for its 'Prior Approval' or determining if its 'Prior 

Approval ' will be required. This allows the Local Planning Authority to consider the proposal 's likely impacts in regard to certain factors (e.g. transport and General Permitted Development Order 2015 – Visual Guide (Final Draft Version) 

2 Last updated: Oct 2021 

highways) and how these may be mitigated . Again , please cross -reference this Guide with the Legislation . After Classes 3 and 20 , a table summarises the 

Prior Approval Conditio ns relevant to each part. Most permitted d evelopment rights are subject to conditions and limitations. 

In some areas of the country, known generally as 'designated areas ', permitted development rights are more restricted. For example, if you live in: a

Conservation Area ; a National Park ; an Area of Ou tstanding Natural Beauty ; a World Heritage Site or the Norfolk or Suffolk Broads (N/A) .

These Article 2(3) 'designated areas ' and other situations where PDRs might not apply are depicted at the start of each part. Please note that the Green Belt 

is not a 'designated area ', so PDR s apply here . H owever, in a new development , a condition restricting PDRs could have been imposed to maintain the 

'openness ' of the Green Belt. Therefore, please check any planning conditions that may have been imposed , with planning permission, on your property ; by 

using NCC 's public access planning application search. Planning applicat ions and decision notices back to 1974 are available on Public Access. The Council 

do es not hold records before this date. Should any documents be missing , you can ask the Team to check for further documents. Requests can be made 

by email to planningfilerequest@northumberland.gov.uk (fo r details, see the Historic planning applications section of the website). 

Prior Approval Notifications (PAN) are different from a Planning Application because the deve lopment has already been permitted by the right . In contrast, 

with planning application s, the LPA de termines an applicat ion by considering the Development Plan and material considerations. The PNA process takes 

these considerations out of the Planning Officer s' hands, instructing them on what issues they might consider and placing them within the Legislation, i.e. 

the Law. Therefore, it is for the Planning Inspectorate and the Planning Courts to decide what the conditions mean. 

This 'Case Law ' process has been es pecially relevant to Part 3 Class Q 'Barn Conversions ', clarif yin g that an agricultural building must be 'struc turally sound '

to be converted under the Class and what that means . Additionally, Case Law has been relevant in clarifying the role of Planning Officers in the PNA 

process. Planning appeal s have determined that "prior approval condition interpretation a matter of planning judgement " for the Planning/Case Officer to 

make . Therefore, we have almost gone full circle . Prior Approvals should be approached by Planning/Case Officers in the same p lanning application process ,

i.e. by utilising planning judgement (they determine what it means on a case by case basis as relevant to the proposed development) . See the presentation 

for mor e information. 

Several Classes within the GPDO refer to 'original dwellinghouse '. 'Ori ginal ' is defined within the '2. In terpretation ' section within the Legislation. Of 

relevance to this Guide, it typically refers to a dwellinghouse as it was built or as it was on 1 July 1948 if it was built before then . This is as opposed to the 

existing dwellinghouse, which is in its current state, or its state immediately before carrying out development. Any additions since 1 July 1948 must be 

taken into account when considering a proposal against its relevant conditions. For example, Part 1 Class A , limitation b) "as a result of the works, the total 

area of ground covered by buildings within the curtilage of the dwellinghouse (other than the original dwellinghouse ) would exceed 50% of the total area of 

the curtilage (excluding the ground area of the original dwellinghouse) ".

This Guide will now explain GPDO 2015 Parts 1 'Householder ', 3 'Change of Use ', 14 'Renewable Energy ' and 20 'New Dwellinghouses '.Planning Jungle Limited

Introduction: 

This is one of a number of documents produced by Planning Jungle Limited (www.planningjungle.com ). This company provides one of the most 

comprehensive resources available relating to householder permitted development legislation, and one of the only sources of consolidated versions of 

planning secondary legislation. 

About this document: 

This is the free version of the “ Part 1 of the GPDO - Visual Guide ” document, which provides a visual guide to Part 1 of the GPDO .

This free version is accessible by anyone , including people who are not members of the Planning Jungle website. As such, you are welcome to distribute 

this document in its original form (i.e. without alterations). 

Important Disclaimer: 

The following “Important Disclaimer” is applicable to all of the documents produced by Planning Jungle Limited: 

“The information provided by Planning Jungle Limited (including the documents produced by Planning Jungle Limited and the mat eri al on the website 

www.planningjungle.com) is for general information purposes only. Such information does not constitute legal or other professional advice, and must not 

be relied on as such. While we endeavour to keep such information up -to -date and correct, we make no representations or warrant ies of any kind about 

the completeness, accuracy, or suitability of such information. Any reliance you place on such information is therefore stri ctl y at your own risk. In no event 

will we be liable for any loss or damage that may arise out of your reliance on such information.” Is the property a HOUSE? 

(Part 1 of the GPDO applies to C3 houses, might apply to C4 “small” HMOs* and sui generis “large” HMOs*, but does not apply to flats (including maisonettes)). 

# Is the property a LISTED building? 

(For a listed building, Class E doesn’t apply, and most PD works will still require listed building consent (which is a separ ate requirement)). 

# Is the property on ARTICLE 2(3) land (Conservation Area, AONB, National Park, Broads, WHS)? 

(On article 2(3) land, Classes AA and B don’t apply, and Classes A, E, G, and H become more restrictive). 

# Have PD rights been removed by an ARTICLE 4 direction? 

(An article 4 direction may remove some or all of the property’s PD rights). 

# Have PD rights been removed (or affected) by a CONDITION on a previous planning permission? 

(This could be an issue if the property was built, or converted from another use, from 1948 onwards, or even if the property has been extended since 1948). 

# Has the property PREVIOUSLY been extended? 

(Some of the PD limitations and conditions are affected by existing extensions, particularly if the new extension would be attached to an existing extension). 

# Also remember: 

• For a larger single storey rear extension under Class A, or for any works under Class AA, the development must not begin before the developer successfully 

completes the prior approval process , and it’s also necessary to check whether the property is on a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) .

• The Part 1 Classes d o not apply to a dwellinghouse that was converted under Part 3 Classes G, M, MA, N, P, PA, or Q [or O in the case of Part 1 Class A A]. 

• The Part 1 Classes d o not apply to a dwellinghouse that was built under Part 20. 

• It’s not possible to combine (as a single operation) PD works with works that are granted PP by the LPA. For example, if the LPA grant s PP for an extension 

with a door, it’s not possible to build an extension with a window by relying on the PP from the LPA for the extension and PD rights for the window .

• PD rights do not apply where the existing building or use is unlawful (see article 3(5) of the GPDO). 

• (*) Note: For different conclusions as to whether Part 1 of the GPDO applies to HMOs, see the “ Part 1 of the GPDO - GENERAL Appeal Decisions ” document.

By inclusion with the GPDO \n\n(Schedule), these rights are derived from a general planning permission that is permitted not by the Local Planning Authority but, at source, by \n\nGovernment. You can carry out these works without the need for a planning applicati on .\n\nThese were first introduced in 1948, when Planning came into force in the UK and contained Classes that remain today, like householder , but other specific \n\nClasses unique to the time , such as repla cing war destroyed buildings. The most recent, complete Legislation is 2015 . H owever, there have been several \n\namendments since then , which have brought in new Classe s and disposed of some Parts. For example, Part 20 'New Dwellinghouses ' and a new Use Class \n\nOrder , and its consummate Use Class E, on 31 Aug and 01 Sept 2020, respectively. The latter disposed of many Class 3 Change of Use PDRs because they \n\nreferred to old Use Class , depicted on page 19. \n\nIt is not deemed practical to cover all these 20 Classes . T herefore, this Guide will only cover Parts 1 'Householder ', 3 'Change of Use ', 14 'Renewable Energy '\n\nand 20 'New Dwellinghouses ' because it was deemed that these C lasses would be most relevant and interesting to a Parish and Town Council audience . This \n\nGuide aims to explain these Classes visuall y, utilising Google SketchUp to intuitively depict the PD Right allowing the reader to visualise what PD could \n\nachieve. These visual isations are then annotated with their conditions. Please note, these are summarised , so please refer to the full Legislation to gain all \n\nthe detail. For guidance on na vigating the GPDO , please view a PDF version of a presentation delivered on 14 Oct 2021 .\n\nOne such condition on certain classes of permitted development is applying to the Local Planning Authority for its 'Prior Approval' or determining if its 'Prior \n\nApproval ' will be required. This allows the Local Planning Authority to consider the proposal 's likely impacts in regard to certain factors (e.g. transport and General Permitted Development Order 2015 – Visual Guide (Final Draft Version) \n\n2 Last updated: Oct 2021 \n\nhighways) and how these may be mitigated . Again , please cross -reference this Guide with the Legislation . After Classes 3 and 20 , a table summarises the \n\nPrior Approval Conditio ns relevant to each part. Most permitted d evelopment rights are subject to conditions and limitations. \n\nIn some areas of the country, known generally as 'designated areas ', permitted development rights are more restricted. For example, if you live in: a\n\nConservation Area ; a National Park ; an Area of Ou tstanding Natural Beauty ; a World Heritage Site or the Norfolk or Suffolk Broads (N/A) .\n\nThese Article 2(3) 'designated areas ' and other situations where PDRs might not apply are depicted at the start of each part. Please note that the Green Belt \n\nis not a 'designated area ', so PDR s apply here . H owever, in a new development , a condition restricting PDRs could have been imposed to maintain the \n\n'openness ' of the Green Belt. Therefore, please check any planning conditions that may have been imposed , with planning permission, on your property ; by \n\nusing NCC 's public access planning application search. Planning applicat ions and decision notices back to 1974 are available on Public Access. The Council \n\ndo es not hold records before this date. Should any documents be missing , you can ask the Team to check for further documents. Requests can be made \n\nby email to planningfilerequest@northumberland.gov.uk (fo r details, see the Historic planning applications section of the website). \n\nPrior Approval Notifications (PAN) are different from a Planning Application because the deve lopment has already been permitted by the right . In contrast, \n\nwith planning application s, the LPA de termines an applicat ion by considering the Development Plan and material considerations. The PNA process takes \n\nthese considerations out of the Planning Officer s' hands, instructing them on what issues they might consider and placing them within the Legislation, i.e. \n\nthe Law. Therefore, it is for the Planning Inspectorate and the Planning Courts to decide what the conditions mean. \n\nThis 'Case Law ' process has been es pecially relevant to Part 3 Class Q 'Barn Conversions ', clarif yin g that an agricultural building must be 'struc turally sound '\n\nto be converted under the Class and what that means . Additionally, Case Law has been relevant in clarifying the role of Planning Officers in the PNA \n\nprocess. Planning appeal s have determined that \"prior approval condition interpretation a matter of planning judgement \" for the Planning/Case Officer to \n\nmake . Therefore, we have almost gone full circle . Prior Approvals should be approached by Planning/Case Officers in the same p lanning application process ,\n\ni.e. by utilising planning judgement (they determine what it means on a case by case basis as relevant to the proposed development) . See the presentation \n\nfor mor e information. \n\nSeveral Classes within the GPDO refer to 'original dwellinghouse '. 'Ori ginal ' is defined within the '2. In terpretation ' section within the Legislation. Of \n\nrelevance to this Guide, it typically refers to a dwellinghouse as it was built or as it was on 1 July 1948 if it was built before then . This is as opposed to the \n\nexisting dwellinghouse, which is in its current state, or its state immediately before carrying out development. Any additions since 1 July 1948 must be \n\ntaken into account when considering a proposal against its relevant conditions. For example, Part 1 Class A , limitation b) \"as a result of the works, the total \n\narea of ground covered by buildings within the curtilage of the dwellinghouse (other than the original dwellinghouse ) would exceed 50% of the total area of \n\nthe curtilage (excluding the ground area of the original dwellinghouse) \".\n\nThis Guide will now explain GPDO 2015 Parts 1 'Householder ', 3 'Change of Use ', 14 'Renewable Energy ' and 20 'New Dwellinghouses '.Planning Jungle Limited \n\n# Part 1 of the GPDO - Visual Guide (FREE VERSION) \n\nLast updated: July 2021 (regular updates not required) \n\nIntroduction: \n\nThis is one of a number of documents produced by Planning Jungle Limited (www.planningjungle.com ).

For example, if the LPA grant s PP for an extension \n\nwith a door, it’s not possible to build an extension with a window by relying on the PP from the LPA for the extension and PD rights for the window .\n\n• PD rights do not apply where the existing building or use is unlawful (see article 3(5) of the GPDO). \n\n• (*) Note: For different conclusions as to whether Part 1 of the GPDO applies to HMOs, see the “ Part 1 of the GPDO - GENERAL Appeal Decisions ” document. \n\n# What to check BEFORE giving advice on householder permitted development rights: \n\n> www.planningjungle.com\n\n# Typical 1930s -1950s Council house \n\n# with a rectangular footprint OTHER LIMITATIONS: \n\n• No verandah, balcony, or raised platform. \n\n• No two -storey side extension. \n\n• Two -storey extension ≥ 7m to rear boundary. \n\nMust not extend \n\nbeyond a side \n\nelevation that \n\nfronts a highway, \n\nor the principal \n\nelevation. \n\nEAVES height: \n\n• ≤ 3m if within 2m \n\nof a boundary. \n\n(This prevents two -\n\nstorey extension \n\nclose to boundary) \n\n• Not higher than \n\neaves of house. \n\nREAR projection \n\nif SINGLE storey: \n\n• (*) ≤ 3m for \n\nterrace or semi -\n\ndetached house. \n\n• (*) ≤ 4m for \n\ndetached house. \n\nREAR projection \n\nif TWO -storey: \n\n• ≤ 3m. \n\nSIDE projection: \n\n• ≤ ½ width of \n\noriginal house. \n\n≤ 50% coverage \n\nof original garden. \n\nCONDITIONS: \n\n• Materials “of a similar appearance” to existing house. \n\n• Upper -floor side windows obscure -glazed and non -opening. \n\n• Roof pitch of two -storey extension same as original house. \n\nMAX height: \n\n• ≤ 4m if single \n\nstorey. \n\n• Not higher than \n\nridge -line of house. \n\n(*) NOTE: For the \n\nsystem of larger \n\nrear extensions, \n\nsee the next page. \n\n> www.planningjungle.com\n\nARTICLE 2(3) LAND: \n\n• No cladding. \n\n• No side extension. \n\n• No two -storey rear extension. \n\n# CLASS A - GENERAL EXTENSIONS AND ALTERATIONS: \n\n“The enlargement, improvement or other alteration of a dwellinghouse” ARTICLE 2(3) LAND: \n\n• NOT allowed \n\non article 2(3) land NOR \n\non a Site of Special \n\nScientific Interest (SSSI). \n\n# CLASS A - LARGER SINGLE STOREY REAR EXTENSIONS (from 30/05/2013 onwards): \n\n“... development permitted by Class A which exceeds the limits in paragraph A.1(f) but is allowed by paragraph A.1(g) ...” \n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: \n\n• The development must not begin before the developer \n\nsuccessfully completes the prior approval process .\n\nFor more information, see the following: \n\n“Part 1 of the GPDO - Larger Rear Extensions - Guide ”\n\nREAR projection \n\nif SINGLE storey: \n\n• ≤ 6m for \n\nterrace or semi -\n\ndetached house. \n\n• ≤ 8m for \n\ndetached house. \n\nREAR projection \n\nif TWO -storey: \n\n• Not allowed. \n\nOTHER LIMITATIONS AND CONDITIONS: \n\n• The larger rear extension must comply \n\nwith all of the limitations and conditions \n\nshown on the previous page (unless shown \n\notherwise on this current page). \n\n> www.planningjungle.com\n\n# CLASS AA - ADDITIONAL STOREYS (from 31/08/2020 onwards): \n\n“The enlargement of a dwellinghouse consisting of the construction of [up to two additional storeys / one additional storey] ... ”\n\nMax height ≤ 18m. \n\nARTICLE 2(3) LAND: \n\n• Class AA does NOT apply \n\non article 2(3) land NOR \n\non a Site of Special \n\nScientific Interest (SSSI). \n\nOTHER LIMITATIONS AND CONDITIONS: \n\n• Resulting house must be C3 dwellinghouse. \n\n• Similar materials, and no side windows. \n\n• See legislation for full info. \n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: \n\n• The development must not begin before the developer \n\nreceives from the LPA a notice granting prior approval .\n\nFor more information, see the following: \n\n“Part 1 of the GPDO – Summary of Amendments since 2013 ”\n\n> www.planningjungle.com\n\nNote: Any additional \n\nstorey must be on \n\nthe “principal part” \n\nof existing house. \n\nClass AA does NOT \n\napply if the house \n\nwas built either: \n\n• Before 01/07/1948. \n\n• After 28/10/2018. \n\nFLOOR to CEILING \n\nheight (internal): \n\n• ≤ 3 m, AND \n\n• ≤ Floor to ceiling \n\nheight of the \n\nshortest storey of \n\nthe “principal part” \n\nof existing house .\n\nRoof pitch same as \n\nexisting house .\n\nHEIGHT if existing \n\nhouse = 1 storey: \n\n• = 1 additional storey. \n\n• ≤ 3.5m above \n\nexisting house. \n\n• ≤ 3.5m above highest \n\nother attached building. \n\nHEIGHT if existing \n\nhouse ≥ 2 storeys: \n\n• ≤ 2 additional storeys. \n\n• ≤ 7m above \n\nexisting house. \n\n• ≤ 3.5m above highest \n\nother attached building.
