FAQ
---

### What is Tweet Hunter?

Tweet Hunter is an all-in-one Twitter growth tool, designed to help you grow and monetize your Twitter audience. Our goal is to make is as easy as possible for you to create high-performing content, build an audience around your topics of expertise, monetize and attract opportunities.

### Who is Tweet Hunter for?

Tweet Hunter is for every person and brand looking to build a Twitter following and generate more sales, subscribers, clients (or any business goal) through Twitter. When we created Tweet Hunter, all of us had different audience sizes (from 100 followers to 50K). Which is why Tweet Hunter is great to start a Twitter account from scratch or to keep growing an already established one with tens of thousands of followers.

### How can Tweet Hunter help me grow my audience on Twitter?

Tweet Hunter helps you at every stage of growing a Twitter account. Whether it’s to create more and better tweets and threads, increase their reach, improve the business ROI they drive, or even engage with other people. We have developed an advanced, Twitter-dedicated AI engine as well as custom features that exist nowhere else in the market. And we keep adding more value in the product every single week.

### How much does it cost to use Tweet Hunter?

All our plans include a free 7-day trial as well as a 30-day refund policy, no questions asked. That effectively means you can use Tweet Hunter for up to 37 days and still ask for a refund if you change your mind.

The plans start at $49/mo. That includes every single feature we have except for those involving AI-writing. These can be found at the superior plan that costs $99/mo, but we run significant discounts depending on your follower size. Check it out by clicking on any “Try it free” button.

### What if I don’t like it?

That’s fine, it happens. If you don’t like it, you can very easily cancel at any point in time straight from the app, or just send us an email. You can also ask for a refund which we’ll happily provide for up to 30 days after your payment.

### I don’t get it. Are you recommending I copy other people’s tweets?

No. Definitely not. Not only is this something you shouldn't do, it also won't work. Perhaps in the short term you'll get a little bit more engagement, but you are bound to be called out for it at some point and lose credibility. It also goes against Twitter's Policy to be purposefully creating identical or near-identical content repeatedly.

What we believe is it’s perfectly fine and an effective process to consume amazing content that helps you come up with your own authentic ideas and content. It’s what everyone does, in just about every field and line of work. Artists learn and get inspiration from artists before them. So do athletes. Scientists. Designers. And so does everyone on Twitter.

What’s not OK is to take people’s content and claim it as your own.

### How does scheduling and automation help me build a Twitter audience?

Here’s the common scenario: you start out super motivated and spend hours on Twitter every single day, tweeting, replying, sending DMs, etc. And after a couple weeks, you don’t see the results you were hoping for, lose your motivation, and quit. Does that sound familiar? It happened to us as well.

The truth is Twitter isn’t a short-term effort that pays off immediately. It takes commitment, consistency, and a great deal of effort to make it. We make it as easy and effortless as it possbile with inspiration features, scheduling and automation.

Inspiration and scheduling allow you to make sure you have content ahead of time and ready to be published so you don’t feel the daily pressure of having to log on to Twitter and get a great tweet idea right away. It also allows you to enjoy a well deserved break from social media whenever you’re on vacation.

Automation allows you to not waste time with low-value tasks such as sending DMs to people who reply to your tweets, or retweeting yourself in the middle of the night so those folks in Tokyo can see your Twitter content.

You get the idea. It’s about making Twitter quicker, less energy-draining, and overall more effective than it currentl is for you and your business.

### Is this safe to use?

We hold ourselves to a high standard when it comes to developing features that respect Twitter's Policy and Terms of Use.

However, if you use Tweet Hunter to circumvent Twitter's Terms of Use, you are putting your account at risk. We have developed many safeguards to keep your account safe, but please note that any behavior that can be associated to spam is against Twitter's Terms of Service. That includes things like repeatedly copy/pasting content written by other people, sending mass amounts of direct messages to people who haven't agreed to it, or posting copy/pasted replies at scale.

But of course those are also tactics that only work in the short term on Twitter. "Hacks", if you will. We strongly encourage you to be part of the smart people out there who know that Twitter growth is driven by effort and consistency more than hacks and short-term tactics.

### I want to get more Twitter followers, what should I do?

At Tweet Hunter we believe in consistency and effort. Every "overnight success" is largely due to weeks, months and sometimes years of investment. Growth in followers won’t be linear, even people with 100K+ followers sometimes get less than 10 in a day. Growth is made of bursts and peaks, and these don’t happen if you’re not there.

Which is why we talk a lot about consistency.

The more consistent you are, the more opportunities for growth you have. People will call it luck or talent, it’s not.

Once you have that mindset, there are a few basic things to know about follower growth:

*   It’s better to only have one (max 2) topics you talk about.
    
*   Tweets, replies and DMs that hold value drive a lot more followers and sales.
    
*   Even if you’re a brand, it’s good to sound like a real person on Twitter, not a sales rep or marketing exec.
    
*   Daily presence is strongly recommended, at least Monday through Friday.
    
*   Relationships \> Followers -\> aim for relationships and get more followers and more sales. That means DMs and engaging with people are just as important as tweeting.
    

These are some quite common advices that we believe to be true. But there also a lot more to learn in Tweet Hunter University, a 25+ page guide available to you for free upon signing up.

Things you should avoid doing to get more followers include anything that might lead to a low quality audience: purchasing followers on dodgy websites, running giveaways 5 times a day, and other similar tactics. The end goal isn't followers, it's to build an audience that will attract new opportunities for you.

### I feel I’m not ready for Twitter yet. What should I do?

We believe Twitter is very much like SEO when it comes to delivering results. It’s not a short term game and more likely something that pays off after a few weeks or months of effort.

Which means that the longer you delay starting, the longer you delay results. There is no way to catch up on the time you lost. So if you do consider Twitter to be an important channel, we suggest you start even if you don’t feel ready. Better to take it slow but to set the pieces moving and learn, than to remain static and lose months of growth and progress.

If you’re convinced that Twitter is a minor sales or acquisition channel for you or your brand, know that we have seen first hand so many types of businesses flourish on Twitter. People on Twitter are very engaged and passionate, and with over 350M users, there are customers there waiting for you.

Still, it's true, Twitter isn't for everyone. If you don't feel the urge for results, and if you're OK delaying those by a few months, it's alright to postpone!
