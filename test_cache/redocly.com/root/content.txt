/ First we built

The #1 API docs tool according to the internet

We believed in APIs at Rebilly. So we built the best OpenAPI docs renderer we could to turn more APIs into revenue.

Many others found our tool useful for the same purpose. Eight years later, Redoc is the most popular API docs tool on GitHub, npm and, as the legend has it, outer space too.

/ Product showcase

In fact, this entire website is built in Redocly

Redocly is based on a stack that’s very familiar to all our engineers and designers. It’s basic React, CLI tools, CSS and some well-documented config

//

The main thing is that our API reference is extremely easy to update. Engineers just worry about the code. Right now I can keep the docs up to date with very minimal work.

I found Redocly through a random Google search. I then found that several companies I respect (including NASA and Docker) were already using the tool, so I looked more closely... Once I figured it out, I was hooked.

The main deciding factor in choosing Redocly was the ability to build an automated pipeline from GitHub to customer-facing docs. This was critical to reducing friction in our developer flow.
