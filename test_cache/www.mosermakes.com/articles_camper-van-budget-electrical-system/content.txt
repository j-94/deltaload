Camper Van Budget Electrical System

Capabilities

*   200Ah lead-acid battery
    
*   1000W Inverter
    
*   up to 440W Solar Input
    
*   30A Alternator Charging
    

This is the system I designed and built for my Ford Transit camper van back in 2019. I’m now calling it the “budget” system because it feels that way compared to all the high power systems you see on the internet today. Regardless of that, it is still very capable for powering all your basic needs in a camper van. It has plenty of power to be able to run roof vents, lighting, a 12V fridge and charge your gadgets. The 1000W inverter provides 110V AC power to things like laptop chargers or small AC appliances.

Upgrade recommendation! Nowadays, LiFePO4 batteries are a much better choice than lead-acid. I would recommend replacing the 200Ah lead-acid batterie with a 100-200Ah of LiFePO4 batteries.
