We do not take a ‘one size fits all approach’ and encourage you to think outside the box.

Throughout the project, communication has been timely and pertinent as work progressed. We very quickly built an excellent rapport with everyone at The Qube and we have been very impressed by the professionalism that has been demonstrated at all stages.

What a pleasure it has been to work alongside The Qube to provide our new classroom. All staff are a credit to the company, nothing was too much trouble. Having had several years of contractors on the school site I can comfortably state the The Qube were by far the best I have worked with and would have no hesitation in recommending them to others.

We have been delighted with the product and service that we have received from The Qube. It’s exactly what we needed, of very high quality and very attractive as well as practical. I wouldn’t hesitate to use them again or to recommend them.

I would like to take this opportunity of recognising the outstanding conduct of the whole team. They have been courteous, polite and considerate; they have worked solidly from dawn to dusk and beyond. The quality of work has been exceptional and in the 20 years of working in the public sector I have never been so impressed.

Headteacher, Aclet Close Nursery School

At the time the four buildings were commissioned, the process was considered a major risk; but the manner in which they were delivered by the Qube was highly commendable.

Steven Jenks

Lead Officer Provision and Capital, Bradford Metropolitan Council

The Qube team are a delight to work with , collaborative, accessible and transparent and they delivered a high quality building that is being enjoyed by the students. Since then we have asked for technical advice in regard to details we are producing. Based on our experience I would highly recommend this company.

Nigel Craddock

Project Director, Pascall + Watson

From the early stages Qube were extremely easy to work with. It was however the overwhelming quality of the structures offered by Qube that won us over, after considering a range of options and comparable suppliers, nothing on the market seemed to match the robust strength, attention to detail and aesthetic appeal of their units. I would be more than happy to work again with Qube Structures.
