People rave about all these new productivity hacks, but they don’t seem to make life any easier. (_“So if I’m in the ice bath, who’s checking off my to-do list?”_)

Even though methods like the Pomodoro technique may help with time management, they’re not going to tackle the work for you.

That’s why you need a personal AI assistant that can do just about anything, from writing emails to scheduling meetings.

Say hello to [**Alice**](https://www.heyalice.app/).
