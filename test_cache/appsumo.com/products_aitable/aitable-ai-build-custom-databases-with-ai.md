When you’re managing big projects, you need tools that have a lot of wiggle room.

But because so many tools on the market are stubbornly inflexible, you end up managing projects and customer data with patchwork solutions. (_“This platform is great...for single-tasking.”_)

Wish there was one platform that uses AI to build the kind of databases you need to support all your tasks and customer relationships?

Meet [**AITable.ai**](https://aitable.ai/).

AITable.ai can **turn any datasheet into an online form**, allowing you to gather info from your leads and customers.

Best of all, you’ll be able to **chat with the AI about your projects**, customers, and any other private datasheets you use for work.
