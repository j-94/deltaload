Building a marketing strategy feels like a breeze—until you have to make sense of all the numbers. (_“This feels like math class, except it actually does matter in the real world.”_)

Even when you have all the data, matching insights with specific metrics and drawing conclusions for your marketing strategy can seem overwhelming.

You need a tool that transforms your data into actionable insights, so you can make better decisions in a fraction of the time.

Introducing [**Lebesgue: Smarter Marketing**](https://lebesgue.io/).

#### **Lebesgue: Smarter Marketing analyzes marketing data and generates actionable insights, so you can build better marketing strategies.**

Lebesgue **centralizes key marketing metrics and real-time benchmarks** for ecommerce businesses.

Just **connect the tool to your Google, Facebook, and Instagram Ads⁠** to discover critical mistakes that seriously impact your strategic growth.

Get industry benchmarks to understand how your click-through rate, conversion rate, or cost per mille compares against competitors.

As you run campaigns, you’ll be able to **identify areas of improvement and measure impact** on customer acquisition cost (CAC) and return on ad spend (ROAS).

##### _Track your click-through rate, conversion rate, and daily changes on industry benchmarks._

With Lebesgue, you can **monitor your top three competitors**’ **brand awareness and growth on social networks** like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.

Collect data on your competitors’ Facebook strategy, including their ad posting frequency, underperforming content, and best practices so you can do it even better.

You’ll also be able to **identify competitors bidding on the same keywords** for Google Ads and receive in-depth insights on their ad strategy to improve your own.

And because you can stay up-to-date on your closest competitors, you can also spot new opportunities for your advertising strategies or marketing channels.

##### _Keep tabs on your competitors' Facebook ads strategy and newly launched content._

Thanks to the AI-based copy creator, you can **craft high-converting content** based on market trends, your best-performing work, and competitor content.

Goodbye writer’s block! Now you can **choose your preferred writing style and receive ad copy suggestions** in an instant.

Best of all, Lebesgue is trained to come up with effective ad copy that’s perfectly aligned with your brand voice.

##### _Create high-converting Facebook ad copy using artificial intelligence._

Lebesgue **measures your Shopify customer lifetime value (CLTV)** for every marketing channel, so you can increase your ROAS.

You can **discover your most profitable patrons** and compare customer cohorts that contribute to your business’ profits on a monthly basis.

Instead of guessing your profits, you'll be able to analyze future revenue based on historical data.

Plus, you can **identify channels with lower acquisition costs**, adjust your marketing strategy in a smarter way, and maximize profits.

##### _Get the full picture of your ecommerce business with retention analysis, cohort behavior, and revenue forecasting._

Planning your data-based marketing strategy shouldn’t require you to manually select and analyze hundreds of rows in Excel (which you definitely know how to do _\*shifty eyes\*_).

Lebesuge offers key insights on your marketing metrics, so you can create high-converting campaigns and ensure you ad spend is well spent.

Make smarter marketing decisions.
