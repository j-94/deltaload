Despite all the information available online, it’s still tough to master new subjects. (_“Ignorance is adding 50 random tabs to my favorites.”_)

Between TikTok microtrends, YouTube essays, and Google Scholar, there’s too much information out there and not enough time to learn it all.

But what if you could save PDFs, URLs, design files, and more in your own digital library—and then use an AI copilot to study it all?

Say hello to [**IKI.AI**](http://iki.ai/).
