# Plato | Build flexible internal tools


Build flexible internal tools


## Content

Developers Connect.  

----------------------

Devs connect Plato to their databases and APIs, providing a safe foundation on which anyone can build tools. Plato can run either in the cloud or self hosted in a Docker image.

1

### Connect your Database

Whitelist our IP, then connect your relational database or warehouse. All queries are live. Data is never stored in Plato.

2

### Connect your APIs

Connect your internal APIs and SaaS endpoints, exposing them to your team as simple forms.

3

### Secure Access

Secure data with SSO and granular permissions. Define custom views that restrict your teammates access to your database.

Operators Build.
----------------

Your business doesn't stand still. Neither should your tools.  
‍Plato is a live workspace, like Excel or Airtable, that lets operators extend their tools in real time.

### Query your DB with the ease of Airtable.

Plato provides an Airtable-like UI for managing your database with CRUD operations, inline edits, and custom views.

### Extend Schema without modifying the DB.

Extend your existing tables with virtual columns that live entirely in Plato. Or create entirely new tables, just like in Airtable.

### Automate your work with Record & Replay.

Creating automations has never been this easy. Whether it's for data pipelines or application controls like button clicks and form submissions, just press record.

### Build rich apps with Drag & Drop.

Create new apps out of dozens of builtin components such as tables, buttons, forms, and dynamic formulas.

### Build Form Workflows without writing code.

Build custom workflows for daily operations such as onboarding users, filing claims, or submitting purchase orders.

The workspace for agile operations.
-----------------------------------

Developers choose Plato to give their teammates tools that evolve as fast as their business.
