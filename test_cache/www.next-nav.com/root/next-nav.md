* * *

*   Install the extension from VS Code Store
*   Open a Next.js project that is using the App Router in VSCode
*   Launch Next.Nav by clicking the icon on the status bar (have to have Next.Nav enabled on status bar icons)
*   Alternatively, Launch Next.Nav by opening the command palette using (Ctrl+Shift+P in Windows/Linux) or (Command+Shift+P in MacOS) and typing Next.Nav highlight and press Enter

Route Traversal
---------------

* * *

* * *

*   You can traverse into sub trees/folders by pressing the sub-directory icon (to the right of the client/server) of the node you want to become the root node
*   From the sub-directory, you can exit to the original tree by press the exit button on the root node. If this button is not there, you are already in the original tree.
*   The original tree is determined by the initial folder path the extension opens on or the path you enter into the path field.

Getting Alternative File Structure
----------------------------------

* * *

* * *

*   For most applications, the file structure will populate automatically. If you aren't using the src/app file strucutre, you will initially see a tutorial tree.
*   If you aren't using the src/app file structure or you simply want to use a different directory as the root directory, copy the path of the root directory. It can be the full path or relative path.
*   Click the import button in the top right and paste the path.
*   Note that if you simply want to enter a sub directory, use the sub directory button on the nodes. Pasting a path into the import path field will make that directory the new root directory. You won't be able to traverse back up when doing this.

Opening a File
--------------
