Maximize the power of AI for your code
--------------------------------------

*   ### Accurate Auto-completion
    
    As you write code, Refact already knows what's next. By combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning, it uses your entire coding environment as a source of context and delivers the most accurate suggestions.
*   ### Integrated In-IDE Chat
    
    Ask a question directly in your IDE. Refact, already aware of your entire codebase, can answer all your queries. Just select the code, ask the chat to modify it, and send the changes back as a diff.
*   ### Personalized Toolbox
    
    The Toolbox helps you explain, summarize, refactor your code, write documentation, and find bugs. You can even ask it to generate new code for you. Need more? It's fully customizable, you can create your own commands.
*   ### Best LLMs
    
    Choose from 20+ large language models that suit your needs, such as Mistral, Llama3, or GPT-4 for chat, and Code LLama or StarCoder for completion, with the opportunity to fine-tune them. You can also try our efficient Refact/1.6B model. [Explore all available LLMs.](https://docs.refact.ai/supported-models/)

### Fine-tune a Model on Your Company's Codebase

Train on files that you think are good - this way, the model will learn to emulate good style and practices. A fine-tuned code completion model generates more relevant suggestions. As a result, you will see a measurable increase in the percentage of code written by the model: **from about 30% to 45%**.

### Keep Your Company's Code Secure

Deploy Refact on-premise: on your own servers or private cloud. **Your data never leaves your control.** Telemetry from the plugins goes to your server and nowhere else. You can verify what the code does; it's open-source.
