easy to use, and percise product on the market right now, and it improves from day to day!](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/673f65be949f6db046d06193)[### Saif Darwish Game Developer Meshy has been a game-changer for my game development process. The platform’s intuitive interface and powerful tools for generating 3D assets have saved me countless hours. I particularly appreciate the flexibility in exporting various formats, making it easy to integrate assets into my workflow.](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/673f2fc87993ca83aad6f491)[### Max Casu AI Creator Incredible text to 3D and more! No limits to your imagination. If you have a creative mind, you can indulge yourself in creating everything that comes to mind, in a 3D version. The latest update has brought further improvements, furthermore in just 60 seconds 8 results of what we are going to create are generated. Of these, we can request an upscale or rather a refinement of the result. There are 3 3D generation possibilities which are as follows: from text, from image and the fantastic retexture function. I am one of the lucky winners of the retexture contest which gave away color stickers printed with a 3D printer! It is possible to export your creation in video format and in the glb format exportable to 3D editing software. Rating: 5 stars deserved!!](https://www.producthunt.com/products/meshy/reviews?review=701252)[### Tom Blake Digital Artist The level of texture and ease of the UI are incredible and unmatched. I use way too many 3D tools and this sits at the top of my workflow. Thanks Meshy!](https://www.producthunt.com/products/meshy/reviews?review=800684)[### Jon Draper AI Animator & Developer My current go-to for AI 3D model generation tool. The latest Meshy 4 generations have been a huge leap in terms of quality for both text and image to 3D. Plus I've already got lots of value out of the easy biped/quadruped rigging and walking animation option. Also, it's great to see the texturing improvements and the ability to retexture or fix textured sections (via the text-to-3d approach).](https://www.producthunt.com/products/meshy/reviews?review=801638)[### Gabriele Romagnoli 3D Artist Who would have said that at some point we could use #AI to #texture our #3D models? @MeshyAI can really texture anything.
