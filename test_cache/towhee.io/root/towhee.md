x2vec, Towhee is all you need


## Content

x2vec, Towhee is all you need
-----------------------------

Towhee is an open-source machine learning pipeline  
that helps you encode your unstructured data into embeddings.

[](https://docs.towhee.io/Getting%20Started/quick-start/)

Key Features
------------

*   ### Easy to Use
    
    You can use our Python API to build a prototype of your pipeline and use Towhee to automatically optimize it for production-ready environments.
    
*   ### Various Modalities
    
    From images to text to 3D molecular structures, Towhee supports data transformation for nearly 20 different unstructured data modalities.
    
*   ### Blazing Fast
    
    We provide end-to-end pipeline optimizations, covering everything from data decoding/encoding, to model inference, making your pipeline execution 10x faster.
    
*   ### SOTA Models
    
    We provide 700+ pre-trained embedding models spanning 5 fields (CV, NLP, Multimodal, Audio, Medical), 15 tasks, and 140+ model architectures. These include BERT, CLIP, ViT, SwinTransformer, data2vec, etc.
    
*   ### Fully Integrated with Ecosystems
    
    Towhee provides out-of-the-box integration with your favorite libraries, tools, and frameworks, making development quick and easy.
    
*   ### Pythonic API
    
    Towhee includes a pythonic method-chaining API for describing custom data processing pipelines. We also support schemas, making processing unstructured data as easy as handling tabular data.
