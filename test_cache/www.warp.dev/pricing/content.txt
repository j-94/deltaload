    **More on our Zero Data Retention Policy** Instead of OpenAI’s default policy of retaining data for 30 days for trust and security reasons, OpenAI will not retain any data for any period of time for users on Warp Enterprise. Your data is never used for training OpenAI’s models, even on the Free and Team plans.
    
*   SAML-based SSO
*   End-to-end encryption for Warp Drive and session sharing
*   Dedicated account manager with onboarding support through Slack

Your data stays between you and the AI
--------------------------------------

Warp does not allow OpenAI or Anthropic to use your data for model training. Our “hands off” approach also means your terminal input and output data is never stored on Warp servers. Any data you enter for Warp AI interactions, including AI command suggestions, gets passed directly to OpenAI or Anthropic APIs without Warp interference.
