Warp keeps me in flow.
----------------------

> Warp has been the one tool I’ve continuously reached for time and time again. It’s helped me level up my skills as a developer, and it keeps me in the flow thanks to the ability to ask questions right from the command line.

Modern UX
---------

Experience the command line, unleashed.

Warp comes with quality of life features built-in. Auto-complete commands, edit like an IDE, and customize your terminal from themes to keybindings.

[Learn about modern editing](https://www.warp.dev/modern-terminal)

*   ### Navigate with blocks and edit inline
    
    Move up and down through input/output blocks, then edit multi-line commands by placing your cursor where you want to type.

*   ### Complete commands faster with smart suggestions
    
    Warp suggests commands, switches, and arguments for over 400 CLI tools and personalizes its recommendations as you work. Suggestions from Warp feel like having a second brain.

*   ### Make it yours with themes and custom configs
    
    Customize everything from fonts and colors to keybindings and launch configs. Build your own prompt or use popular themes like Starship or Powerlevel10k.

Knowledge is power. Warp Drive is your private, secure library where developers can upload and share resources, from repeatable runbooks to templatized commands.

[Explore Warp Drive](https://www.warp.dev/warp-drive)

*   ### Work together on the command line
    
    Share sessions and command line controls in real-time for pair programming and live assistance.

    ![Image 89](https://leading-bell-3e1c02e64d.media.strapiapp.com/warp_drive_1_sharing_f8c4afece5.svg)
    
*   ### Sync tools for your team automatically
    
    Update docs, runbooks, and environment variables in your team’s private drive. Warp automatically pulls down updates and makes them usable from the sidebar or command palette.
    
    ![Image 90](https://www.warp.dev/static/image/r/w=3840,q=50,format=auto/5_2_warp_drive_509c2739ea.jpg)
    
    ![Image 91](https://leading-bell-3e1c02e64d.media.strapiapp.com/envvars_87be6457c4.svg)
    
*   ### Standardize common processes with team-wide runbooks
    
    Create (and update) interactive Notebooks that live alongside the command line. Notebooks are always available in read-only mode when you’re not connected to a network.

    ![Image 93](https://leading-bell-3e1c02e64d.media.strapiapp.com/notebooks_2_668e9117cf.svg)
    
*   ### Templatize commands to re-use in only a few keystrokes
    
    Save parameterized commands as workflows for your own re-use or to reinforce standards with your team.

Privacy and security
--------------------

Transparency and control at every touchpoint.

![Image 96](https://www.warp.dev/static/image/r/w=3840,q=50,format=auto/6_tech_specs_30db0abbb1.jpg)

*   ### Keep content safe and secure.
    
    Control access and enable settings that keep secrets out of view. Integrate with LastPass and 1Password.
    
    #### Features:
    
    Access control, domain restriction, secret redaction, dynamic environment variables
    
*   ### Opt into AI on your own terms.
    
    Natural language detection happens locally. AI only engages when you take action. Your data never trains public models.
    
*   ### Turn app analytics on or off.
    
    You decide whether to send your usage data and crash reports to Warp's product team. Use Warp's [network log](https://docs.warp.dev/features/network-log) to peak under the hood.
