The notebook for  
reproducible research.
-----------------------------------------

Runs anything you can put into a Docker container. Improve your workflow with polyglot notebooks, automatic versioning and real-time collaboration. Save time and money with on-demand provisioning, including GPU support.

ML researchers start training models on GPUs within minutes. When using machines with GPUs, we save time on setup by loading GPU drivers automatically. Once training is done, the instance is shut down automatically to avoid additional cost.

Data Scientists connect external data sources securely and use familiar visualization libraries like Vega, Plotly or matplotlib. Notebooks can be collaborated on in real-time and shared privately or published to the whole internet.

Library authors publish their documentation as notebooks containing runnable samples next to the text. Readers can remix these notebooks and experiment with the samples on their own.

Professors provide notebooks as coursework with runnable exercises to their students. Students don’t waste time on setting up their local environment.

Scientists can argue from evidence and increase trust by providing a reproducible, runnable analysis, including all raw data to be verified and built upon by peers. DOIs are provided upon request.

#### Full support & templates for common programming environments

Work together  
in real-time
----------------------------

**Groups & Collaborators**  
Create public or private groups to work with your collaborators under a shared profile or invite them on a per-notebook basis. Secrets can be shared among collaborators.

**Real-Time Sync**  
All edits to a Nextjournal notebook are commit-less and synchronized in real-time among connected clients. This allows editing of a notebook by multiple authors at the same time.

Rapid and full reusability
--------------------------

**Remix entire notebooks**  
Enabled by immutability, “Remix” allows you to quickly build off a copy of any previously published notebook, including all of its dependencies.

**Create, share and reuse Docker images**  
The entire file system can be published as Docker image with a single click. These images can be pulled to run locally or reused in other Nextjournal notebooks.

Polyglot Notebooks
------------------

In Nextjournal, you can use multiple programming language runtimes together in a single notebook. Values can be exchanged between runtimes using files.

**Easy-to-manage runtime states**  
Runtimes are Docker containers that are orchestrated by a separate “Runner” application. This allow resetting an individual runtimes state without affecting other runtimes.

**Arbitrary installations**  
Nextjournal can install anything as long as a runtime offers Bash. Environment variables can be set for each runtime through a UI.

**Default environments**  
We offer default environments for various languages and use cases that come pre-populated with libraries for plotting, number crunching and more.

Automatic Provisioning & Shutdown
---------------------------------

Every notebook that is run, gets its own compute instance provisioned automatically. We keep a pool of small runners around with 4GB of RAM per instance that will boot instantly. Larger instances are available on-demand. When your computation is done, we shut it down automatically to save costs on idling machines.

**Full GPU support**  
Currently, we have full support for up to 8 NVIDIA Tesla K80, P100 or P100 Workstation GPUs per runtime with minimal setup necessary.

Data & Secrets Management
-------------------------

**Connect your data**  
Besides uploading files, Nextjournal notebooks can bring in private data from S3 and Google Cloud Storage. You can also clone private GitHub repositories or import images from Docker Hub.

**Secrets management**  
Secrets can be added to your account’s private secrets storage that lives outside notebooks and computational environments. Secrets are stored securely in [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) and can only be read by your profile.
