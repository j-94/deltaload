Enterprise OCI Account Executive at Oracle

> The thing I need to do the most is be consultative and and show that I know a lot about my prospect’s particular company. It’s much harder to do without Aomni because it takes a lot of time to do all this research in an organized fashion that works in conjunction with my CRM.

Founder & CEO at Parakeet

> Aomni is worth its weight in gold. The power of this tool is for our reps to be sitting around a coffee table running this model and brainstorming how to get into an account. They would have had to dig and dig and dig to find these nuggets that I got in 2 seconds.
