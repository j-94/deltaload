mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1 seems good.
======================================

[Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/?f=flair_name%3A%22Discussion%22)

./main -m mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q6\_K.gguf --min-p 0.01 --top-p 1.0 --color -t 5 --temp 0 --repeat\_penalty 1 -c 4096 -n -1 -p "<s\>\[INST\] Sally (a girl) has 3 brothers. Each brother has 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have? \[/INST\]"

Sally has 1 sister.

Here's the logic behind this:

1.  We know that Sally has 3 brothers.
    
2.  Then we are told that each of her brothers has 2 sisters.
    
3.  Since all the brothers share the same sisters, there can only be two girls in the family (including Sally).
    
4.  Therefore, Sally has 1 sister.
    

This question often tricks people because they assume each brother has 2 different sisters, but in this case, the brothers share the same sisters. \[end of text\]
