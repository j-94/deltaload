Rules


---------

*   1
    
    Please search before asking
    ---------------------------
    

Before submitting a post to ask a question, please search this subreddit and related resources.

To maintain community quality, questions that fall under Rule 3 (Low Effort Posts) may be removed. This includes questions like:

*   How to use Llama?
    
*   Where to download models?
    
*   What models can I run with this hardware?
    
*   Help! I'm having _\[insert error message here\]_
    

Questions that cannot be found by searching are always allowed. If you need help with PC building and budgeting, try [r/buildapc](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/)

*   2
    
    Off-Topic Posts
    ---------------
    

Posts must be directly related to Llama or the topic of LLMs.

*   3
    
    Low Effort Posts
    ----------------
    

Asking questions is allowed, but it's kindly asked that users first spend a reasonable amount of time searching for existing questions on this subreddit or elsewhere that may provide an answer.

Since this subreddit receives a high volume of questions daily, this rule is in place to help reduce identical posts.

If you can't find an answer to your question and want to make a post here, please be clear and comprehensive when asking to improve your chances of getting an answer from the community.

*   4
    
    Limit Self-Promotion
    --------------------
    

This is an open community that highly encourages collaborative resource sharing, but self-promotion should be limited. The 1/10th rule is a good guideline: self-promotion should not be more than 10% of your content.

Additionally, if you are sharing your project:

*   Please do not use any sensationalized titles.
    
*   Do not use any affiliate links when linking to content. Links must be directly to the source, such as GitHub or Hugging Face.
    
*   Do not flair your own project as News. Use Resources.
    

*   5
    
    Follow Reddit's Content Policy
    ------------------------------
    

Posters and commenters are expected to act in good faith. Treat other users the way you want to be treated. Avoid straw-manning and bad-faith interpretations. Avoid presenting misinformation as factual. Please remember to follow Reddit's Content Policy ([https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)).
