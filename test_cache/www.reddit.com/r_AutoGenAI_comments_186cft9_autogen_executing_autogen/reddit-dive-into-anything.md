autogen executing autogen
=========================

[Project Showcase](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoGenAI/?f=flair_name%3A%22Project%20Showcase%22)

I've been diving into the autogen code with the intention of exploring how it can be used or extended towards more general capabilities (i.e. in the direction of AGI). My initial goal has been to write an autogen script that can spin off a separate functioning instance of autogen without prior knowledge of autogen. Finally had some success today, here's the output:

[autogen executing autogen](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CWzR-YC59HaZVBWIxxNpKsIKn75NnVljrSio4Nzy8iw/edit?usp=sharing)

The code is still pretty messy but I hope to be able to share it at some point. The main features I added include:

*   An "Agent Council" that discusses which agent should act next.
    
*   Updated group chat functionality such that all agents have awareness of each other.
    
*   A "consult\_archive\_agent" function who's purpose is to:
    
    *   Check if domain knowledge (i.e. a llama\_index index) exists for a certain request
        
    *   Extract relevant domain knowledge if needed (currently restricted to google search of github repos)
        
    *   Use domain knowledge to respond via RAG
        
*   Generally injecting reasoning (i.e. LLMs) into various steps.
    
*   Quite a few agents with (relatively) complex system messages.
    

Would love to hear any thoughts/feedback.
