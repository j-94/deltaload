### Greater Control, Enhanced Design.




-------------------------------------------

Introducing new features for enhanced design control, better user experience.

We’re excited to bring you our October updates! Though it's a bit late, it's because we've packed this release with surprises and critical updates. This is one of the biggest updates we’ve ever made to the platform. This month, we’ve focused on providing you with greater control and consistency in your designs, new features to improve user experience, and… a surprise beta feature that could take your website and client management to the next level. Hint: It’s about payments and client billing—read on for more!

1\. Custom Tailwind CSS Classes

This feature lets you add a truly personalized look and feel to your website, ensuring it aligns perfectly with your brand’s visual identity. Whether refining the button shape or adding a specific flair to your blocks, you can now do it your way with full creative control.

Check out the Tailwind CSS documentation to learn more about all available classes. It’s easy—just copy and paste the classes to use them.

![Image 428: Image Description](https://cdn.lindoai.com/c/recWb5MDAKXtEkkWV/images/61034323.png)

2\. Secondary Font for Headings
-------------------------------

Typography is a key part of your brand's identity. With the new Secondary Font for Headings option, you can elevate the visual appeal of your content.

You can apply a secondary font to individual pages via Page Theme for a unique page experience or globally using the Global Theme option, ensuring a consistent yet distinct font hierarchy across your entire website.

![Image 429: Image Description](https://cdn.lindoai.com/c/recWb5MDAKXtEkkWV/images/21066021.png)

3\. Device Visibility Handler
-----------------------------

Not all content is meant for every device. With the new Device Visibility Handler, you can control which elements appear on:

*   Desktop
*   Tablet
*   Mobile

This allows you to create tailored experiences for users based on the device they’re using, providing better content targeting and improving user engagement. You can choose to show or hide:

*   Blocks
*   Images
*   Buttons
*   Icons

![Image 430: Image Description](https://cdn.lindoai.com/c/recWb5MDAKXtEkkWV/images/03683647.png)

-----------------------

Website layouts require precision, and that’s why we’ve introduced Block Width Control.

You can now adjust block width individually for each section to achieve a precise layout. Additionally, apply width settings to a Page Theme for a consistent look on a particular page, or set it as a Global Theme to ensure uniformity across all your pages. This flexibility helps you maintain consistent visual structure and gives you the ability to quickly adapt your site’s layout without compromising on style.

![Image 434: Image Description](https://cdn.lindoai.com/c/recWb5MDAKXtEkkWV/images/51124433.png)

![Image 435: Image Description](https://cdn.lindoai.com/c/recWb5MDAKXtEkkWV/images/20567055.png)

8\. Button Design Control
-------------------------

We've now added Button Design Control for all buttons on a page or theme.

Instead of updating button styles one by one, you can now customize them all at once—either for a single page or for the entire website using a Global Theme. This ensures a consistent design throughout your website, while also saving you valuable time.

![Image 436: Image Description](https://cdn.lindoai.com/c/recWb5MDAKXtEkkWV/images/15662510.png)

9\. Link Design Toggle
----------------------

Links and buttons often serve different purposes, and now you can easily distinguish between them.

With the new Link Style Toggle, you can switch between different link styles. Use a simple link style for navigation menus and a button style for call-to-action buttons. This separation helps you maintain design consistency while providing better visual cues for users navigating your site.

![Image 437: Image Description](https://cdn.lindoai.com/c/recWb5MDAKXtEkkWV/images/39736001.png)

10\. Reset Theme Settings

This feature offers peace of mind when experimenting, allowing you to quickly reset if needed.

We listened to your feedback and revamped our platform's structure to ensure a smoother and more intuitive experience. After thorough testing with our beta users, we’re thrilled to make these updates available to everyone.

Additionally, we're opening our beta tester program to partners interested in actively shaping the future of lindo.ai. Let’s dive into the details:

Design


--------

To offer more flexibility and ease in styling your website, we’ve rolled out several major updates, making design management more intuitive. Here’s what’s new:

1. Global Website Theme in Settings
-----------------------------------

The introduction of the Global Website Theme marks a new era in styling websites on the lindo.ai platform. We upgraded the entire design structure, making it easier than ever to apply consistent styles across all your website pages directly from the website settings. This revolutionary feature allows you to apply your chosen design to current and future pages. In our next update, we'll introduce Preset Styles to further elevate this feature.

To try it out, head over to your website settings and open the Theme tab.

Available Options:

*   Mode: Light / Dark
*   Font: Choose from over 1,000 fonts
*   Palette: Set your accent color
*   Page Background Color
*   Button Roundness
*   Image Roundness

We’ve added a shortcut to the Global Website Theme in the Page Design sidebar. Now, if you're tweaking your page styles and want to apply them across your entire site, you can do so effortlessly. You can even set these styles to be applied to all current and future website pages built with the current theme.

SEO

Optimizing your website for search engines is key to driving traffic and visibility. We’ve introduced new features to give you more control over your SEO settings:

4\. SEO - Canonical
-------------------

A canonical tag helps search engines understand which version of a page is the "official" or preferred one, especially when you have similar or duplicate content. This can prevent content duplication issues and boost your SEO rankings. You can now set canonical tags in the SEO tab within page settings.

![Image 451: Image Description](https://cdn.lindoai.com/c/recWb5MDAKXtEkkWV/images/96027889.png)

5\. SEO - No Index
------------------

A no-index tag is used to prevent search engines from indexing a specific page, keeping it from appearing in search results. This is useful for pages you want to keep private or don't wish to show up in search engines. You can now easily set this option in the SEO tab within page settings.

![Image 452: Image Description](https://cdn.lindoai.com/c/recWb5MDAKXtEkkWV/images/03814571.png)

A no-follow tag instructs search engines not to follow certain links on your page, helping you control which links pass on "link juice" or ranking power. This is often used for external links you don't want to endorse. You can set this tag in the SEO tab within page settings.

![Image 453: Image Description](https://cdn.lindoai.com/c/recWb5MDAKXtEkkWV/images/01710618.png)

We’ve also added new options to control how your links behave on your website:

7\. Link - Open in New Tab
--------------------------

Now, you have the option to set links to open in a new browser tab, ensuring a smoother navigation experience for your visitors. This can be configured when setting a URL for a link on your page.

![Image 454: Image Description](https://cdn.lindoai.com/c/recWb5MDAKXtEkkWV/images/84652111.png)
