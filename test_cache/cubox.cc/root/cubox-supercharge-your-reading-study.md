Cubox has profoundly transformed my world, artfully turning a sea of scattered information into a serene, accessible oasis. More than a mere tool, it's become an essential companion in organizing my thoughts, acting as an effective extension of my own intellect. Its truly my second brain, effortlessly managing my digital universe.

I was incredible intrigued when I found out about Cubox. It is a beautifully designed piece of software, packed with lovely features to take content consumption to another level.

I finally have found an app that understands my needs when it comes to storing all of my minds inspiration and using tags and keywords as the main source to filter. I feel like I can finally breathe and replace Notion.

Perfect addition for the other PKM nerds out there. I wrote a review a while ago, but I just wanted to add how amazing this app is for personal knowledge management. The deep link is SO useful for how I personally like to link notes to their references. The annotated highlighting is also really great, and the combination of tags and folders is a trifecta not available in any other bookmark or read-it-later app.

I’ve been looking for a more powerful read-it-later alternative to Pocket and Cubox ticks a lot of boxes. It offers highlights, annotations, email-import and connects with a range of other tools.

Beautiful design and function. Love this app. This app is allowing me to get organized in a way I didn't think I would. I'm able to find things that I want to review quickly and easily. Well worth the subscription.
