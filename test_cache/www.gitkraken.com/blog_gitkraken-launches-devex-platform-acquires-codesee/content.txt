**_TL;DR:_** _GitKraken acquires CodeSee and launches the unified [GitKraken DevEx Platform](http://gitkraken.com/devex), enhancing workflows across all major development environments and setting new standards in developer tools. Dive in to discover our powerful new features and how they contribute to simplifying your coding life._

Almost a decade ago, we introduced GitKraken Client with a clear mission: make Git simpler for developers. The power of GitKraken was (and still is 😄) user-friendly visualizations that help developers get the most out of Git, without all the headaches.

We’ve come a long way since then, expanding our toolkit with [GitLens for VS Code](https://www.gitkraken.com/gitlens) (JetBrains and Visual Studio coming this year) and introducing both [GitKraken CLI](https://www.gitkraken.com/cli) and [Browser Extension](https://www.gitkraken.com/browser-extension) to integrate Git workflows across all environments.

Today, we’re taking a monumental leap forward with the acquisition of CodeSee—a pivotal step in consolidating our innovative suite of tools into a cohesive Developer Experience (DevEx) platform. By weaving CodeSee’s advanced workflow automation and code understanding into our ecosystem, we’re setting a new standard in developer tools.

Here’s what’s new and noteworthy:

We’re combining CodeSee’s cutting-edge technology with our powerful tools to create the [GitKraken DevEx platform](https://www.gitkraken.com/devex). This unified platform is all about boosting your workflow across GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, Jira, and Trello. It simplifies your development process and provides the support you need, no matter where you code.

_What do we mean by a unified DevEx platform?_ It means combining all of our essential dev tools—like GitLens and our leading Git GUI—with powerful collaboration features to create a **seamlessly connected experience** across desktop, IDE, terminal, web, and mobile environments. And that’s not all—here’s what else we’re unveiling today as part of our DevEx platform:

*   **CodeSee:** We’ve acquired [CodeSee’s](http://www.codesee.io/) code automation and code health capabilities. This acquisition adds:
    *   Powerful code visualization and workflow automation
    *   Intuitive code and function maps
*   **[Code Suggest](https://www.gitkraken.com/solutions/code-suggest):** As simple as Google Docs for PRs. This powerful new feature lets you edit and comment anywhere in your project – not just the bits that were already changed, breaking free from GitHub’s restrictive comment-only feedback style. It’s about making the review process comprehensive and genuinely helpful.
*   **[Launchpad](https://www.gitkraken.com/solutions/launchpad)**: Meet your new real-time command center for managing PRs, Issues and work-in-progress. It’s your one-stop-shop to organize, prioritize, and act more efficiently.
*   **GitKraken.dev:** Access GitKraken’s powerful features from anywhere with our new browser-based tool—perfect for managing your workflows on-the-go and quick code reviews.
*   **AI-Powered Development:** Boost your productivity with our AI capabilities, now including support for Google Gemini. These tools automatically generate commit messages, deliver detailed code insights, and help devs navigate complex codebases, enhancing both your development speed and team performance. Soon, expect even more benefits with capabilities through strategic partnerships.
*   **Your beloved Git GUI evolves to GitKraken Desktop:** New name, huh? More like a new era. Changing our flagship product’s name is a reflection of the importance of the desktop as the access point to our DevEx platform for millions of developers. 

A Decade of Impact: Looking Back and Charging Forward
-----------------------------------------------------

In the past decade, we’ve changed the game for millions of developers – our tools have been used to visualize over 1 billion (yep, with a B) code commits. What used to be confusion, is now clear and manageable. Think about it: millions of commits, pull requests, and merge conflicts managed more efficiently every single day. The result? Hundreds of millions of hours saved for developers like you each year – allowing you to focus on what truly matters: writing great code.

But we’re not just kicking back and admiring the view. We’re taking what we’ve learned and pushing further… much further. Imagine a world where [PR & code review frustrations](https://www.gitkraken.com/developer-problems/pr-and-code-review) are minimized, where [Git complexities](https://www.gitkraken.com/developer-problems/git-is-complicated) are laughably simple, and where even the [messiest merge conflicts](https://www.gitkraken.com/developer-problems/merge-conflicts) are easy to sort out (or never happen in the first place).

That’s not just a dream; we’re making it happen – and today’s announcements are just the beginning. We’re not just adapting; we’re leading the charge in redefining the developer experience. Let’s dive into how these exciting developments will shape the next decade of coding.

Today’s Code Reviews: What’s Broken
-----------------------------------

While we’ve made serious strides in easing Git pain over the years, our work isn’t over—some areas still cause major friction for developers and teams. At the top of the list: PR & code reviews. Existing tools just don’t cut it — they’re clunky, inflexible and make us take the long way around.

Here’s what developers have told us:

*   **Friction and Restrictions:** GitHub’s restrictive feedback style limits PR comments to lines near changes, overlooking broader code improvements – not to mention the clunky nature of adding code suggestions to a textbox as markdown – it’s slow and annoying.

*   **Visibility and Context:** Code changes often arrive without much context, leaving devs to piece things together, a challenge that’s even greater when working remotely.

*   **Cognitive Overload:** Code reviews, already inherently disruptive, become even more taxing due to complexities like limited context, inflexible commenting, and clunky interfaces.

*   **Delayed Collaboration:** Teamwork often stalls until the PR stage, skipping early chances to refine and adjust.

These issues, amplified by remote work, slow down collaboration. Developers need tools that match modern workflows, not outdated processes. It’s time for a change to more intuitive and flexible code review tools.

Introducing GitKraken Code Suggest
----------------------------------

Say hello to GitKraken [Code Suggest](https://www.gitkraken.com/solutions/code-suggest), your new buddy for tackling the clunkiness of traditional code reviews. As simple as suggesting changes in a Google Doc—this tool allows you to suggest real code changes across your entire project, not just the lines of code that were changed in a PR. By allowing more comprehensive context for changes, Code Suggest helps teams avoid common mistakes, speed up reviews, and boost overall code quality—the true aim of any code review.

What’s New?
-----------

*   **Suggest Changes Anywhere:** With Code Suggest, suggest changes in any part of a file, or even a completely different file, breaking free from the confines of current tools.
*   **Direct and Easy:** It’s straightforward—no more wrestling with markdown in a cramped textbox. Work directly in your IDE or wherever you code, speeding up reviews and cutting down on hassle.
*   **Fits Your Flow:** Code Suggest fits right into your workflow, whether you prefer IDE, command line, desktop or browser. This minimizes disruptions and keeps your focus on the code.

Comparing the Old and New
-------------------------

Here’s how we’ve all been commenting on PRs since: forever (look familiar? 😁). Just a basic textbox for comments on, and around, changed lines. Not exactly the height of flexibility.
