### Learn how the most forward-thinking architectural firms  
revolutionize their planning processes.

*   On average, SWAPP conducts up to 80% of construction documentation tasks, potentially reducing project workflow time by 50%. However, exact time savings vary depending on project complexity and the elements involved.
    
*   SWAPP acts as an architecture Co-Pilot throughout your project's lifetime. It efficiently manages changes as they occur, automatically adapting documentation across all phases of the project. This streamlined iteration process significantly reduces the time and effort typically required for project modifications.
    
*   SWAPP learns from your existing projects and adheres to your firm-specific standards. It continuously evolves based on feedback and usage, ensuring the output aligns with your quality expectations and aesthetic preferences.
    
*   Yes. SWAPP's AI is trained to handle a wide range of architectural styles and complexities. For unique design elements, the system can be further trained on your specific requirements, ensuring it can handle even the most innovative designs.
    
*   As a vendor-agnostic, cloud based system, SWAPP is built to integrate seamlessly with popular BIM software like Revit. It adapts to your existing workflows, enhancing rather than disrupting your processes.
    
*   Not at all. SWAPP is an architect co-pilot, not a replacement. It automates tedious tasks, allowing you to focus more on creative aspects. You maintain full creative control while SWAPP handles the repetitive documentation work.
    
*   SWAPP learns from your data to improve its performance but doesn't replicate or store your designs. Each client's data is segregated and used only to train their specific AI models, ensuring your intellectual property remains protected.
    
*   While SWAPP significantly reduces errors, the architect is always in control and thus ultimately responsible for document accuracy. You should treat SWAPP as a highly efficient assistant with human oversight for critical decisions. For accountability, our system maintains a detailed audit trail of all changes.
    
*   SWAPP employs a privacy approach. Your data is secured and separated as part of our solution, producing a bespoke, tailored approach for each firm. We use state-of-the-art encryption and access controls to ensure your data remains confidential.
    
*   No. Each client's data is strictly segregated. Our system is designed to maintain the highest data privacy and security levels. This also ensures accuracy and a solution tailored to your firm's standards.

However, exact time savings vary depending on project complexity and the elements involved.\n    \n*   SWAPP acts as an architecture Co-Pilot throughout your project's lifetime. It efficiently manages changes as they occur, automatically adapting documentation across all phases of the project. This streamlined iteration process significantly reduces the time and effort typically required for project modifications.\n    \n*   SWAPP learns from your existing projects and adheres to your firm-specific standards. It continuously evolves based on feedback and usage, ensuring the output aligns with your quality expectations and aesthetic preferences.\n    \n*   Yes. SWAPP's AI is trained to handle a wide range of architectural styles and complexities. For unique design elements, the system can be further trained on your specific requirements, ensuring it can handle even the most innovative designs.\n    \n*   As a vendor-agnostic, cloud based system, SWAPP is built to integrate seamlessly with popular BIM software like Revit. It adapts to your existing workflows, enhancing rather than disrupting your processes.\n    \n*   Not at all. SWAPP is an architect co-pilot, not a replacement. It automates tedious tasks, allowing you to focus more on creative aspects. You maintain full creative control while SWAPP handles the repetitive documentation work.\n    \n*   SWAPP learns from your data to improve its performance but doesn't replicate or store your designs. Each client's data is segregated and used only to train their specific AI models, ensuring your intellectual property remains protected.\n    \n*   While SWAPP significantly reduces errors, the architect is always in control and thus ultimately responsible for document accuracy. You should treat SWAPP as a highly efficient assistant with human oversight for critical decisions. For accountability, our system maintains a detailed audit trail of all changes.\n    \n*   SWAPP employs a privacy approach. Your data is secured and separated as part of our solution, producing a bespoke, tailored approach for each firm. We use state-of-the-art encryption and access controls to ensure your data remains confidential.\n    \n*   No. Each client's data is strictly segregated. Our system is designed to maintain the highest data privacy and security levels. This also ensures accuracy and a solution tailored to your firm's standards.\n    \n\n### Learn how the most forward-thinking architectural firms revolutionize their planning processes\n\n14390\n-----\n\n### +\n\nHours of tedious tasks saved by SWAPP\n\n2298\n----\n\n### +\n\nSheets created and annotated by SWAPP\n\n300\n---\n\n### %\n\nIncrease in Sq. ft year  \nover year with SWAPP\n\n### Customers rate SWAPP #1 in construction documents automations\n\nSeamless Integration\n--------------------\n\nAs a vendor-agnostic, cloud based system, SWAPP is built to integrate seamlessly with every BIM software.
