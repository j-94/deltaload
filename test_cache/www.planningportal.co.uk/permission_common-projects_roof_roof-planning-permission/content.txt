Alterations to the roof of a house (e.g. to re-roof or insert skylights) is considered to be permitted development (not requiring planning permission) subject to the following limits and conditions.

These are specific to "_any other alteration to the roof of a dwellinghouse_" as detailed in [Schedule 2, Part 1, Class C of the The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/596/schedule/2/part/1/crossheading/class-c-other-alterations-to-the-roof-of-a-dwellinghouse)1 (as amended).

There are different rules for:

*   "_the enlargement of a dwellinghouse consisting of an addition or alteration to its roof_" (Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B) which are [detailed in our 'Loft conversion' section](https://www.planningportal.co.uk/permission/common-projects/loft-conversion)2.
*   _“enlargement of a dwellinghouse by construction of additional storeys”_ (Schedule 2, Part 1 Class AA) which are [detailed in our ‘Additional Storeys/Extending Upwards’ section](https://www.planningportal.co.uk/permission/common-projects/additional-storeys-extending-upwards)3.
*   “_installation or alteration etc of solar equipment on domestic premises”_ (Schedule 2, Part 14, Class A) which are [detailed in our ‘Solar panels’ section](https://www.planningportal.co.uk/permission/common-projects/solar-panels)4.

If these limits and conditions are not met, or Permitted Development rights have been removed in the area, then an application for Householder/Full Planning Permission will be required.

**The current house:**

*   Is not a building containing one or more flats, or a flat contained within such a building
*   Was not changed to be used as a house (from a previous non-residential use) under permitted development rights.
*   Was not built as a ‘New Dwellinghouse’ under permitted development rights.

**Limitations on the proposed development:**

*   Must not project more than 150 millimetres from the plane of the existing roof slope.
*   Must not exceed the height of the existing roof.
*   Side-facing windows must be obscure-glazed; and, if opening, to be 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which they are installed.
