### Planning permission

When submitting an application, in most cases there will be a planning application fee. However, for some types of consent, e.g. listed buildings and planning permission for relevant demolition in a conservation area, no application fee is required.

You can calculate the planning application fee yourself using the Planning Portal's online fee calculator. If you are unsure about the appropriate fee for your application, you are strongly advised to contact your local planning authority in advance of submitting your application, as an incorrect fee will delay the processing of your application.

[Fee Calculator](https://www.planningportal.co.uk/app/fee-calculator)Our fee calculator can be used as a standalone tool, but it is also a step in the online application process. You can also [download a guide to the fees for planning applications in England](https://ecab.planningportal.co.uk/uploads/english_application_fees.pdf)1.

Where the local planning authority fails to determine your application, or where you submit a valid application and then withdraw it at any time before it has been determined, the application fee will not be refundable. However, if the local authority fails to determine your application, you can appeal.

### Financial Transaction Service

Since September 2018, the Planning Portal has processed all payments for planning applications made online. This means that your online application is paid for using a standardised set of payment options, which are detailed below.

A service charge of £58.33 +VAT will apply to all planning applications submitted through our online application system that attract a fee of over £60. This is payable at the time of submission.

Payments for online applications should not be made directly to local planning authorities.
