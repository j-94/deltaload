For academic publishers
-----------------------

We work with innovative publishers who want to make it easier to share scientific knowledge and increase author engagement with their journals. Many of them are also exploring new approaches to the digital transformation, automation, and implementing the FAIR principles. If these are things you’re looking for, check out Nanodash – we designed it to specifically cater those needs.

For GLAM
--------

We also work with galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM) that want people around the world to contribute to the knowledge about their collections. Watch this space, as we will soon be sharing news about our collaboration with the [Colonial Collections Consortium Datahub](https://wp-dev.colonialcollections.org/index.php/en/datahub-2/), which will be used by academic researchers and citizen scientists.

What we do
----------

We provide a managed service, called Nanodash, to publish scientific findings in a way that is both human-readable and machine-actionable. This Software-as-a-Service is also designed to browse these findings – with automated aggregations and more. It connects to a platform that is fully open, semantic, decentralized, and aligned with the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

Our work is guided by integrity, openness, and freedom to operate.

Nanowhat?
---------

Nanopublication is a format consisting of tiny snippets of information about any topic whatsoever that is encoded in a way that computers can understand and humans can easily create. Nanopublication support researchers in finding and aggregating results in their field, and discovering new connections between findings and domains.
