“I went to the site Monday without ArcSite, spent all afternoon printing then marking up on A4 paper. Once I returned, I had to then scan it, convert it to PDF, upload it to Autodesk Design Review, then mark up all the circuits using the correct symbols onto the system. All this could have been done at the source \[using ArcSite\]. Instead, it was done at the office, wasting many hours of time.”
