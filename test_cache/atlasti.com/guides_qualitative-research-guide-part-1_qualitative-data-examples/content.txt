Throughout this guide, we look at [qualitative research methods](https://atlasti.com/guides/qualitative-research-guide-part-1/qualitative-research-methods) and their applications across a range of disciplines in the social sciences. As qualitative researchers, understanding the essence of qualitative data is key to conducting effective [qualitative data analysis](https://atlasti.com/guides/qualitative-research-guide-part-2/qualitative-data-analysis). In this section, we will explore various types of qualitative data that you, as a researcher, may encounter or collect in your field of study.

But first: [What is qualitative data?](https://atlasti.com/guides/qualitative-research-guide-part-1/qualitative-data) Qualitative data, often referred to as 'rich,' 'descriptive,' or 'contextual' data, can provide valuable insights into human experiences, behaviors, and interactions. Qualitative data can capture the nuances, complexities, and subtleties of social phenomena that are difficult to quantify or measure with numbers. While qualitative and quantitative data ultimately go hand in hand, a [qualitative analysis](https://atlasti.com/research-hub/qualitative-analysis) of data focuses on the 'how' and 'why' rather than the 'how many.'

Overall, qualitative data is typically non-numerical and can be difficult to quantify or measure ‘objectively’ when compared to quantitative data. However, qualitative data can provide rich insights into people's experiences, behaviors, and attitudes, all of which can help researchers develop new theories.

In the following subsections, we will provide an overview of different forms of qualitative data that you may encounter in your research, including [interviews](https://atlasti.com/guides/qualitative-research-guide-part-1/interviews), [focus groups](https://atlasti.com/guides/qualitative-research-guide-part-1/focus-groups), [observations](https://atlasti.com/guides/qualitative-research-guide-part-1/observational-research), documents, and [visual materials](https://atlasti.com/guides/qualitative-research-guide-part-2/images-audio-video).

Interviews
----------

[Interviews](https://atlasti.com/guides/qualitative-research-guide-part-1/interviews) are a fundamental method for gathering in-depth information about participants' experiences, perspectives, and opinions. In essence, interviews serve as a conduit for acquiring rich, contextual data that can illuminate the complexities of human behavior and sensemaking.

Qualitative data collection from interviews focuses on participants' responses to the researcher's questions, and these can include the participants’ personal narratives, stories, and anecdotes. This data can encompass a range of content, such as emotions, values, motivations, and beliefs from which a [thematic analysis](https://atlasti.com/guides/qualitative-research-guide-part-2/thematic-analysis) can make broader conclusions about a group of people.

### Examples of interviews in research

Interviews have been employed in a diverse array of social science research projects. Let's look at two examples illustrating the value of interview data in qualitative research:

#### Studying the experience of immigrants

Researchers may conduct semi-structured interviews with immigrants to explore their experiences during migration, their integration into host societies, and the challenges they face. The interview data can help illuminate the emotional, psychological, and social aspects of the immigrant experience, providing insights into policy and intervention efforts.

#### Understanding consumer behavior

In a study exploring consumer decision-making, a market researcher might use structured or [semi-structured interviews](https://atlasti.com/research-hub/semi-structured-interviews) to gather information about participants' purchasing habits, preferences, and motivations. This data can help reveal the underlying factors that influence consumer behavior, which can inform marketing strategies and product development.

Field notes
-----------

[Qualitative observations](https://atlasti.com/guides/qualitative-research-guide-part-1/observational-research) are another key method in qualitative research, enabling researchers to directly witness and record social phenomena as they unfold in real-time. The data collected through [observations](https://atlasti.com/research-hub/what-is-qualitative-observation), commonly documented in the form of [field notes](https://atlasti.com/guides/qualitative-research-guide-part-2/field-notes), can provide a wealth of information about the context, behaviors, and interactions that occur within a given social setting. In this subsection, we will discuss the importance of field notes and present examples of how observation-based data have been used in social science research.

Field notes are the written records of a researcher's observations, reflections, and interpretations during the course of their fieldwork. These notes serve as a central resource for [data analysis](https://atlasti.com/guides/qualitative-research-guide-part-2/qualitative-data-analysis), as they capture the context, events, behaviors, and interactions that were observed. Field notes can also include the researcher's personal insights, analytical ideas, and questions that emerge during the observation process.

### Examples of field notes in research

Observations have been employed in a wide range of social science research projects, providing valuable context-sensitive data. Let's use two examples demonstrating the utility of field notes from observations.

#### Studying classroom dynamics

Researchers may conduct observations in educational settings to examine classroom dynamics, teaching methods, and student engagement. Field notes can help capture subtle interactions between students and teachers, the impact of the physical environment on learning, and the cultural norms that shape educational experiences.

#### Exploring public spaces

In a study of how people use and interact within public spaces, such as parks or plazas, researchers might employ observations to document patterns of usage, social interactions, and the influence of the physical design on people's behaviors. Field notes can provide rich, contextually grounded data that can inform urban planning and design decisions.

Textual data
------------

Textual data, as the name suggests, refers to written or printed materials that convey meaning through text. Textual data can offer valuable insights into people's thoughts, opinions, and attitudes on a particular topic. This form of data can be drawn from a wide variety of sources, including personal documents, organizational records, and digital communications. In this subsection, we will explore the different types of textual data, their potential applications in social science research, and some real-world examples of how researchers have utilized textual data to answer their research questions.

Textual data can be used in various ways to address [research questions](https://atlasti.com/guides/qualitative-research-guide-part-1/research-question) across different fields of science. These data sources can be analyzed using [content analysis](https://atlasti.com/guides/qualitative-research-guide-part-2/content-analysis), [discourse analysis](https://atlasti.com/guides/qualitative-research-guide-part-2/discourse-analysis), or other qualitative analytical techniques to uncover [themes](https://atlasti.com/guides/thematic-analysis/), patterns, and relationships within the text. Note that such analyses can also be used to create statistical models of categorical data to identify frequencies of key expressions and discourse patterns. Textual data can also be used in conjunction with other forms of qualitative data, such as [interviews](https://atlasti.com/guides/qualitative-research-guide-part-1/interviews) or [observations](https://atlasti.com/guides/qualitative-research-guide-part-1/observational-research), to triangulate findings and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the research topic.

### Examples of textual data in research
