Check out these case studies to see the impact.

[#### Work better together The first-class threads in Zulip are **absolutely critical to how we work**. So many people on Hacker News talk about using Zulip — I'm so glad we joined them! **David Lanstein**, _co-founder and CEO of Atolio_](https://zulip.com/case-studies/atolio/)[#### Empower leaders Using Zulip significantly **increases the size of the team** for which a manager can meaningfully know what’s going on. **Gaute Lund**, _co-founder of iDrift AS_](https://zulip.com/case-studies/idrift/)[#### Make decisions faster Some decisions that were blocked for months on GitHub were **resolved within 24 hours** on Zulip. **Josh Triplett**, _Rust Language team co-lead_](https://zulip.com/case-studies/rust/)[#### Simplify knowledge management Using Zulip in a way that feels natural creates an **organized repository** of knowledge _as a side effect_. **Max McCrea**, _Co-founder of Monadical_](https://monadical.com/posts/how-to-make-remote-work-part-two-zulip.html)[#### Organize 100s of workstreams Other apps like Slack would struggle with organizing the flow of information in a complex organization like ours. Zulip’s UI makes it easy to **access all the information you need**. **Jon Jensen**, _CTO of End Point Dev_](https://zulip.com/case-studies/end-point/)[#### Communicate with efficiency I don’t like going back to Slack now. It’s just not as efficient a way to **organize communication**. **James van Lommel**, _Director of Engineering at Semsee_](https://zulip.com/case-studies/gut-contact/)
