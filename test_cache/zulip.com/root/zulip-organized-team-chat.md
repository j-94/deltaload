[#### Work better together The first-class threads in Zulip are **absolutely critical to how we work**.

Zulip’s UI makes it easy to **access all the information you need**. **Jon Jensen**, _CTO of End Point Dev_](https://zulip.com/case-studies/end-point/)[#### Communicate with efficiency I don’t like going back to Slack now. It’s just not as efficient a way to **organize communication**. **James van Lommel**, _Director of Engineering at Semsee_](https://zulip.com/case-studies/gut-contact/)
