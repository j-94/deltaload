I use Recall every day. It helps me quickly condense important information from thought leadership articles and educational YouTube videos. It's great to have place where I can easily store this information knowing that I will come back to it again in the future. I've greatly developed as a founder and leader thanks to Recall.

I've been building several second brains for years and whenever I see a new way to do it, I don't like changing because my other systems already work. But I'm always willing to try because you never know which one would be a drastic improvement on what you're already using. Recall is one of them.
