---------------------------------------------------

[Draw Your Floor Plan](https://app.smartdraw.com/?nsu=1)

Make Floor Plans for Your Home or Office Online
-----------------------------------------------

SmartDraw is the fastest, easiest way to draw floor plans. Whether you're a seasoned expert or even if you've never drawn a floor plan before, SmartDraw gives you everything you need.

Use it on any device with an internet connection. Begin drawing with one of the many included floor plan templates and customize it with ready-made symbols for windows, doors, appliances, and a variety of other floor plan objects.

You and your team can work on the same floor plan by saving it to a shared SmartDraw folder or by using your favorite file sharing apps like SharePoint®, Google Drive™, OneDrive®, and more. You can also share files with non SmartDraw users by simply emailing them a link. Your team can easily leave comments and feedback.

Share your floor plans with others in a variety of common graphics formats such as a PDF, SVG, or PNG. Export them to any Office® or Google Workspace™ application in just a few easy clicks.

drawings\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n[Draw Your Floor Plan](https://app.smartdraw.com/?nsu=1)\n\nMake Floor Plans for Your Home or Office Online\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nSmartDraw is the fastest, easiest way to draw floor plans. Whether you're a seasoned expert or even if you've never drawn a floor plan before, SmartDraw gives you everything you need.\n\nUse it on any device with an internet connection. Begin drawing with one of the many included floor plan templates and customize it with ready-made symbols for windows, doors, appliances, and a variety of other floor plan objects.\n\nYou and your team can work on the same floor plan by saving it to a shared SmartDraw folder or by using your favorite file sharing apps like SharePoint®, Google Drive™, OneDrive®, and more. You can also share files with non SmartDraw users by simply emailing them a link. Your team can easily leave comments and feedback.\n\nShare your floor plans with others in a variety of common graphics formats such as a PDF, SVG, or PNG. Export them to any Office® or Google Workspace™ application in just a few easy clicks.\n\n![Image 51: Floor plan](https://waz.smartdraw.com/floor-plan/img/floorplan.png?bn=15100111939)\n\nSmartDraw is Used by Over 85% of the Fortune 500\n------------------------------------------------\n\n![Image 52: 3M logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/3M_wordmark.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 53: Amazon logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Amazon_logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 54: AT&T logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/ATT_logo_2016.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 55: Cisco logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Cisco_logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 56: Honeywell logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Honeywell_logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 57: Intel logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Intel_logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 58: Johnson and Johnson logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Johnson_and_Johnson_Logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 59: Mariott logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Marriott_Logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 60: Abbott Labs logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Abbott_Laboratories_Logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 61: Motorola logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Motorola_new_logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 62: Northrop Grumman logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Northrop_Grumman_logo_white-on-black.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 63: Oracle logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Oracle_logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 64: Pfizer logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Pfizer_logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 65: Thermo Fisher Scientific logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Thermo_Fisher_Scientific_logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 66: Verizon logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Verizon_2015_logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 67: Wells Fargo logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Wells_Fargo_Bank_Logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 68: 3M logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/3M_wordmark.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 69: Amazon logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Amazon_logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 70: AT&T logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/ATT_logo_2016.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 71: Cisco logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Cisco_logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 72: Honeywell logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Honeywell_logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 73: Intel logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Intel_logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 74: Johnson and Johnson logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Johnson_and_Johnson_Logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 75: Mariott logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Marriott_Logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 76: Abbott Labs logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Abbott_Laboratories_Logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 77: Motorola logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Motorola_new_logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 78: Northrop Grumman logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Northrop_Grumman_logo_white-on-black.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 79: Oracle logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Oracle_logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 80: Pfizer logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Pfizer_logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 81: Thermo Fisher Scientific logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Thermo_Fisher_Scientific_logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 82: Verizon logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Verizon_2015_logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\n![Image 83: Wells Fargo logo](https://waz.smartdraw.com/common/img/fortune500/Wells_Fargo_Bank_Logo.svg?bn=15100111939)\n\nTry SmartDraw's Floor Plan Software Free\n----------------------------------------\n\nDraw floor plans quickly and easily with SmartDraw.\n\n[Draw Your Floor Plan](https://app.smartdraw.com/?nsu=1)\n\n[By continuing to use the website, you consent to the use of cookies.
