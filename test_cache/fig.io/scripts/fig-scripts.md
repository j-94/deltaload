Watch Brendan make a script

Write scripts as a notebook
---------------------------

*   Mix-and-match Code, Markdown, and Inputs in a Jupyter notebook-style interface
*   Use languages like Bash, Python, and TypeScript and easily accept inputs with our terminal UI library
*   More languages and cell types coming soon!

Powerful Terminal UI
--------------------

*   Accept user input easily with Fig's out-of-the-box terminal UI library
*   Customize Text, Dropdown, Toggle, and File Picker components all from the Fig Script editor
*   Terminal UIs aren't your thing? All scripts can be run from the command line directly too.

Collaboration built-in
----------------------

*   Changes are instantly provisioned to your teammates and devices
*   Get insights on how your team is using your scripts
*   Onboarding a new engineer is as easy as adding them to your Fig team

And a whole lot more
