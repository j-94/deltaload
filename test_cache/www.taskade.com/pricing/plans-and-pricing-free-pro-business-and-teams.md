Frequently asked questions.
---------------------------

Upgrade with confidence, 30-day money-back guarantee, on all plans.

What is Taskade AI and AI Requests?

Taskade AI provides **Unlimited AI usage** for you and your team across all workspaces under one subscription, available cross-platform on [web, mobile, and desktop](https://www.taskade.com/downloads). Powered by GPT-4o, Taskade AI helps you automate tasks, brainstorm ideas, and collaborate in real-time.

Premium plans offer unlimited usage with the default model, while advanced models use AI Requests that scale with your team size. Adding more seats increases your team's shared AI pool, ensuring everyone has flexible access to AI resources without individual limits.

**Key features include:**

*   **[AI Project Generator](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958450-ai-project-studio)** – Instantly generate workflows, mind maps, blog content, and more using contextual sources like YouTube videos, PDFs, and web links to boost team efficiency.
*   **[Custom AI Agents](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958457-custom-ai-agents)** – Build an AI team tailored to your needs. Agents automate tasks, brainstorm, and generate content while learning from dynamic sources like Taskade projects and web links.
*   **[AI Automation](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958467-getting-started-with-automation)** – Create intelligent workflows using custom Agent Triggers. Connect Web Search, Website Scraper, YouTube Transcriber, and apps like Slack, Gmail, and Google Sheets to streamline work.

Is my data used to train AI models?

Absolutely not! At Taskade, we prioritize your data's privacy and security. Your data remains secure and confidential, adhering to our stringent data protection protocols in Taskade AI. We pledge not to utilize your information for model training purposes like OpenAI's GPT-4o Turbo. Rest assured that your private and proprietary information remains strictly confidential and is used solely for the intended purpose of enhancing your Taskade experience.

Taskade AI employs strategic integrations and automations to enhance its AI capabilities. We ensure that any data used in this process is shared exclusively with our trusted partners, specifically to support the delivery of Taskade AI features. Our strict policies prohibit partners from using your information for training their models or for any other unrelated purposes. This commitment to data protection ensures that our AI's functionality is in line with the highest standards of data security and user privacy.

Can guests and clients use Taskade for free?

Yes! Taskade allows you to share [Public AI Agents](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958457-custom-ai-agents#h_05461a302e) with unlimited guest usage. You can embed agents on websites or dashboards and let guests interact with them in real-time, including public chats and unlimited AI access. Customize their appearance, and even allow others to copy and use your agents for their own projects.

Taskade also provides [unlimited collaboration](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958373-share-a-project-add-collaborators) and project access for your guests and clients across all plans. Share projects in [various views](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958384-what-are-project-views)—like List, Table, Kanban, and Mind Map—with full chat and edit mode for seamless collaboration.

Additionally, you can use one-click [video call sharing](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958419-start-a-video-call) to connect with clients or guests to hop on a quick chat or video conference.

Only workspace members count towards your plan’s user limit, so you can invite as many guests and visitors as needed!

Do I need to commit to a long-term contract?

Absolutely not! We believe in flexibility, although our subscription options vary by plan type. For Business plans, you have the option to choose a monthly subscription if you prefer short-term commitments. However, all Personal plans require an annual subscription, which comes with its own set of benefits, including a discounted rate compared to monthly billing.

Regardless of your choice, you're always in control. You can upgrade or downgrade your subscription at any time. Should you decide to cancel, rest assured that you'll retain full access to all tasks, projects, workspaces, and content you created while subscribed to Taskade. We guarantee that your work and progress remain yours to keep, no matter what.

Do you offer discounts?

Yes, we offer discounts for students, startups, nonprofits, and educational institutions. To apply for a discount, simply [contact us](https://www.taskade.com/contact).

Does Taskade AI use GPT-4o?

Yes! Taskade AI utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4o to boost productivity for premium users, offering smarter automation, brainstorming, and real-time collaboration.

Free users also benefit from GPT-4o Mini, ensuring that AI-powered features are available to everyone. Upgrade to Pro or Teams plans for **unlimited AI usage** and full access to GPT-4o for more complex tasks.

What kind of teams get the most out of Taskade?

Taskade is ideal for teams looking to automate tasks and enhance collaboration with AI. Whether you're in marketing, product development, or creative industries, Taskade’s **AI Agents** help automate workflows, generate content, and manage projects effortlessly.

With **AI Automation**, you can create **agentic workflows** that connect with apps like Slack, Gmail, Google Sheets, and even custom-built tools, streamlining processes and boosting productivity.

For teams managing multiple projects, Taskade offers **unlimited workspaces** under one account, making it easy to collaborate across different teams and clients seamlessly.

How am I billed when I add new workspace members?

Billing is based on the number of workspace members you invite across all workspaces. Sharing AI agents and projects with editors and collaborators is free on all plans, and guest usage does not count towards your billing.

To add more workspace members, simply [invite them to a workspace](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958486-invite-to-a-workspace).

You can upgrade at any time. For larger teams with custom requirements, please [contact us](https://www.taskade.com/contact).

What payment methods do you accept?

We accept all major credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and more through the trusted payment provider [Stripe](https://stripe.com/customers) to process payment.

Stripe is the same payment provider trusted by companies like Google, Amazon, and Lyft.

What is your refund policy?

Experience total peace of mind with Taskade's 30-day money-back guarantee on all premium plans. If you're not completely satisfied with your upgrade, just let us know within 30 days for a full refund.

With the flexibility to upgrade, switch plans, or cancel at any time, you can confidently explore everything Taskade has to offer. And remember, you can always continue using Taskade for free, even after downgrading.

questions.\n---------------------------\n\nUpgrade with confidence, 30-day money-back guarantee, on all plans.\n\nWhat is Taskade AI and AI Requests?\n\nTaskade AI provides **Unlimited AI usage** for you and your team across all workspaces under one subscription, available cross-platform on [web, mobile, and desktop](https://www.taskade.com/downloads). Powered by GPT-4o, Taskade AI helps you automate tasks, brainstorm ideas, and collaborate in real-time.\n\nPremium plans offer unlimited usage with the default model, while advanced models use AI Requests that scale with your team size. Adding more seats increases your team's shared AI pool, ensuring everyone has flexible access to AI resources without individual limits.\n\n**Key features include:**\n\n*   **[AI Project Generator](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958450-ai-project-studio)** – Instantly generate workflows, mind maps, blog content, and more using contextual sources like YouTube videos, PDFs, and web links to boost team efficiency.\n*   **[Custom AI Agents](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958457-custom-ai-agents)** – Build an AI team tailored to your needs. Agents automate tasks, brainstorm, and generate content while learning from dynamic sources like Taskade projects and web links.\n*   **[AI Automation](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958467-getting-started-with-automation)** – Create intelligent workflows using custom Agent Triggers. Connect Web Search, Website Scraper, YouTube Transcriber, and apps like Slack, Gmail, and Google Sheets to streamline work.\n\nIs my data used to train AI models?\n\nAbsolutely not! At Taskade, we prioritize your data's privacy and security. Your data remains secure and confidential, adhering to our stringent data protection protocols in Taskade AI. We pledge not to utilize your information for model training purposes like OpenAI's GPT-4o Turbo. Rest assured that your private and proprietary information remains strictly confidential and is used solely for the intended purpose of enhancing your Taskade experience.\n\nTaskade AI employs strategic integrations and automations to enhance its AI capabilities. We ensure that any data used in this process is shared exclusively with our trusted partners, specifically to support the delivery of Taskade AI features. Our strict policies prohibit partners from using your information for training their models or for any other unrelated purposes. This commitment to data protection ensures that our AI's functionality is in line with the highest standards of data security and user privacy.\n\nCan guests and clients use Taskade for free?\n\nYes! Taskade allows you to share [Public AI Agents](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958457-custom-ai-agents#h_05461a302e) with unlimited guest usage. You can embed agents on websites or dashboards and let guests interact with them in real-time, including public chats and unlimited AI access. Customize their appearance, and even allow others to copy and use your agents for their own projects.\n\nTaskade also provides [unlimited collaboration](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958373-share-a-project-add-collaborators) and project access for your guests and clients across all plans. Share projects in [various views](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958384-what-are-project-views)—like List, Table, Kanban, and Mind Map—with full chat and edit mode for seamless collaboration.\n\nAdditionally, you can use one-click [video call sharing](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958419-start-a-video-call) to connect with clients or guests to hop on a quick chat or video conference.\n\nOnly workspace members count towards your plan’s user limit, so you can invite as many guests and visitors as needed!\n\nDo I need to commit to a long-term contract?\n\nAbsolutely not! We believe in flexibility, although our subscription options vary by plan type. For Business plans, you have the option to choose a monthly subscription if you prefer short-term commitments. However, all Personal plans require an annual subscription, which comes with its own set of benefits, including a discounted rate compared to monthly billing.\n\nRegardless of your choice, you're always in control. You can upgrade or downgrade your subscription at any time. Should you decide to cancel, rest assured that you'll retain full access to all tasks, projects, workspaces, and content you created while subscribed to Taskade. We guarantee that your work and progress remain yours to keep, no matter what.\n\nDo you offer discounts?\n\nYes, we offer discounts for students, startups, nonprofits, and educational institutions.

Sharing AI agents and projects with editors and collaborators is free on all plans, and guest usage does not count towards your billing.\n\nTo add more workspace members, simply [invite them to a workspace](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958486-invite-to-a-workspace).\n\nYou can upgrade at any time. For larger teams with custom requirements, please [contact us](https://www.taskade.com/contact).\n\nWhat payment methods do you accept?\n\nWe accept all major credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and more through the trusted payment provider [Stripe](https://stripe.com/customers) to process payment.\n\nStripe is the same payment provider trusted by companies like Google, Amazon, and Lyft.\n\nWhat is your refund policy?\n\nExperience total peace of mind with Taskade's 30-day money-back guarantee on all premium plans.
