Best in Class

OpenHands is the leading AI software engineer to date. Our agent can solve over half the problems in the [SWE-bench](https://www.swebench.com/) Verified problem set, and is the first AI engineer to score over 50%. And top researchers in code generation, from over a dozen academic institutions, are helping us improve it every day.

Free as in Freedom

We believe agentic technology is too important to be controlled by a few corporations. So we're building all our agents in the open on GitHub, under the MIT license.
