SWE-agent lets your language model of choice (e.g. GPT-4o or Claude Sonnet 3.5) autonomously use tools to:

*   [fix issues in real GitHub repositories](https://swe-agent.com/usage/hello_world/),
*   perform tasks on the web,
*   crack cybersecurity challenges, or
*   [any custom task](https://swe-agent.com/usage/coding_challenges/).

It does so by using configurable [agent-computer interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15793) (ACIs) to interact with isolated computer environments.
