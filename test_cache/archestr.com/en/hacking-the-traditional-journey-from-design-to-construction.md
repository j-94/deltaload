About **Archestr**

Our story started based on the professional insights and the distinctive vision of one of our co-founders, a successful architect with 15+ years of experience in different markets, to streamline internal communications within the construction industry.

Joining his extensive architectural background with the other core founding members’ wide technical, entrepreneurial, and design knowledge and experiences, we have created a multi-disciplinary balanced team to tackle the identified gaps, create effective solutions, and develop a winning product.

Archestr’s vision is to create a virtual triangular community of architects, developers, and suppliers to facilitate the flow of professional communications between these key ecosystem players.
