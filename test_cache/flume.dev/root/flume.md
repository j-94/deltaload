### Powered by React

Rendering a node editor is as easy as rendering a single React component. All required styles are automatically included.

### Buttery 60fps+ performance

Flume bypasses React renders for smooth rendering of drag-and-drop, zoom, and pan animations, resulting in smooth 60fps+ performance on every device.

### Lightweight footprint

Flume was built from scratch to minimize dependencies and other bloating code. The result is a library that is fast, light, and packed with features.

Model once. Run everywhere!

Flume provides a blazing fast engine for running your logic in a browser, on your server, or in any Javascript environment. Not using a node server? Your logic graphs can also be used in any environment that supports JSON.
