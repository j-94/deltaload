I think the beauty of 4o is still the code interpreter. Give it a scenario that it can run and debug itself then drop it in to a project built with modularity in mind.

This is likely what you are looking for, but it is 185,139 tokens and 25234 loc which likely explains the difficulty with using this in most LLM context windows. (I'd recommend modifying this file to only include detail relevant to the specific code generation task):

[Tic Tacs contain 94.5% sugar but can legally advertise as "0 sugar" because the serving size is less than .5 grams according to FDA labeling rules](https://i.redd.it/kvjhvb46b2ae1.jpeg) by \[deleted\] in [diabetes](https://pay.reddit.com/r/diabetes/)

\[–\][jimmc414](https://pay.reddit.com/user/jimmc414) 2 points3 points4 points 20 days ago\* (0 children)

It seems self explanatory, but I posted this because this appears to be a dangerous fact that most certainly creates unexpected health events. Obviously for many, 94.5% sugar would be problematic, so a label of 0g of sugar seems irresponsible. There should be more public pressure on the FDA to close loopholes like this.

Have you tried Microsoft’s new markdown converter? No LLM dependencies and it’s simple enough to implement.

[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42410803](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42410803)

If it was important enough you could preprocess it through an LLM after markitdown to restore any hierarchical markdown elements to organize and add meaning.

build your prompt with 4o, tell it what you are doing, what you need and make it clear you need only a prompt. This is important - Ask the model to act as a socratic questioner to conduct a Q & A about the requirements and make sure any confusion is hammered out and 4o can explain it back to you. again you are requesting only a prompt to create the code, no code.

Then drop that code generation prompt in o1-mini and let it run.
