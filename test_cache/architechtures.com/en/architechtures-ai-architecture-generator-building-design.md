AI Architecture Generator. Reduces architectural design time. Discover the power of Artificial Intelligence in Architecture


## Content

AI Architecture Generator in Real-Time
--------------------------------------

Used by architects and real estate developers to optimize the feasibility analysis process with regulatory confidence, rapid iterations, and accurate instant insights. Then, to download the standardized initial BIM model of the site to continue with their traditional workflow.

Architechtures facilitates an innovative residential design process in collaboration with Artificial Intelligence. Through our Generative AI technology, users receive in real-time the solution that best fits the entered design criteria. This allows both architects and real estate developers to have full control over the quantitative aspects of the design and focus on decision making. The user evaluates the geometric and analytical results obtained and adjusts the design until completely satisfied. This collaboration between man and machine makes Artificial Intelligence in architecture a new way of approaching residential design.

Input

1.-Introduction of Design Criteria and Modelling

The user inputs the design criteria that the project must meet and defines and models the solution online in an easy and intuitive way in 2D and 3D.

3.-Generation of the BIM solution and Project Data

The platform shows in real-time the resulting BIM solution and all its metrics to be later downloaded in XLSX, DXF, and IFC formats.

How It Works
------------

Generate optimal building designs in real-time
----------------------------------------------

In the initial stages of a residential project is where the most relevant decisions about its feasibility and added value are made. At that time, multiple factors come into play, from quantitative aspects like regulatory compliance, program or cost to other qualitative aspects that impact the architectural design quality. Architechtures encompasses this entire process, helping the designer to meet in an optimal way and in real-time the quantitative requirements to focus on providing the highest architectural value to the project.

Detailed introduction of design criteria

The system allows the introduction of design criteria such as minimum and maximum net areas for each room and typology, minimum dimensions of the rooms, heights and vertical communications specifications to ensure the project compliance.

![Image 102: Home Edition](https://architechtures.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FhomeScreenshot.601939ef.jpg&w=3840&q=75)

Manual project modeling integrated with AI

The user models in 2D and 3D the volume of the above-ground and below-ground buildings and parkings on which the automated design process is performed. The resulting designs can be easily adapted manually to suit user’s requirements.

![Image 103: Building Edition](https://architechtures.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FbuildingScreenshot.c683d183.jpg&w=3840&q=75)

Design optimized to meet users needs

The best solution is the one that best suits the user’s needs. The AI-aided process allows to iterate the design parameters offering in real-time the architectural solution that best suits the user’s standards.

![Image 104: BIM Model](https://architechtures.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FmodeloBim.70f8454c.jpg&w=3840&q=75)

Real-Time BIM model navigable online

The system generates in real-time a BIM model with the geometry resulting from the AI-aided design process, all with a data structure that is completely navigable online to facilitate user review and design edition.

![Image 105: Floor Edition](https://architechtures.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FfloorScreenshot.98d6b218.jpg&w=3840&q=75)

Instant floor areas and project data

The design is completely monitored, showing in real-time the units program, gross floor areas by use and type, breakdown of gross and net floor areas of each type as well as the urban parameters compliance of each solution.

![Image 106: Real-Time Costs](https://architechtures.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FcostsScreenshot.7c83bc24.jpg&w=3840&q=75)

Quantities takeoffs always updated

The system performs a detailed takeoff of every work unit in real-time to let the user input the unit cost for every line. This enables our users to continuosly know the economic impact of each design decision he makes.

Environmental Responsiveness

The system provides an extensive simulation of the building performance in real-time, allowing detailed knowledge of the passive behavior throughout the year. This data is used to provide the building and units layout with the best environmental performance that meet the user's design criteria.

![Image 108: Editor with collaborative comments](https://architechtures.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fmultiuser.0a9483f8.jpg&w=3840&q=75)

Collaborative design

We are soon adding exciting new functionalities so each Design is as collaborative as possible, like a chat, multiple editors, getting notified when there is a change, and tagging your teammates to ask them questions or get approval.

Share your Design
-----------------

With Architechtures you can share a copy of your work with your colleagues, you only need to have their email addresses, and they only need to register (it's free!).

![Image 109: Desgin sharing Popup](https://architechtures.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FshareProject.b6b726ca.jpg&w=3840&q=75)

You can choose to share the copy of your work in View mode so they can only see and navigate through the design (plans, 3D, and budget) or in Edit mode, so they can duplicate it and keep editing on their own.

Design Downloads
----------------

Once the project is defined, the designs are available for download in Report XLSX, DXF and IFC formats.

![Image 110: XLS Icon](https://architechtures.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FxlsBlueprint.129859f9.png&w=256&q=75)

AI Architecture adapted to your needs
-------------------------------------

We train our Artificial Intelligence for Architecture tool and adjust it to your needs so that you can design all your projects in record time. We help you configure it with Parameter Presets so you can be even more efficient when creating your designs and get the most out of Generative AI.

![Image 113: Editor sections](https://architechtures.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FeditorInterface.84f88399.jpg&w=3840&q=75)

1\. Typologies

We train our technology to fully adapt your product, by digitizing specific buildings and units typologies to be used by our enterprise users. Any design rule or specification can also be integrated.

2\. Interface

We can customize the input and output parameters to guarantee a specific design outcome or to show any specific ratio or data coming from the building design in real-time.

3\. Parameters Presets

Each section of the Design parameters and Costs can be stored for later use in a set of Presets. Different configurations can be loaded to streamline the Design process and Cost estimate.

4\. Bill of Quantities

BoQ lines are customizable, and new ratios and key figures can be added to fully integrate the cost estimation within the corporation record and standards.

5\. Financial Planning

We can integrate our customer's feasibility analysis model, so project profitability can be evaluated in real-time for any design decision.

6\. BIM LOD 200+

You can design as many variations of the project as you want, and when you have your ideal project, download the BIM model, and IFC standard, to continue developing your project by adding furniture, MEPS, and construction details.

And if you are missing any parameter in our dashboard to comply with any local regulations or business requirements, do not hesitate to contact us.
