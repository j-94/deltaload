In this paper, as shown in Figure 1, we present a comprehensive workflow for the preliminary stages of architectural design that has not been explored previously. We explore how generative AI technology can be effectively utilized in the early phases of architectural design to generate conceptual plans and 3D models based on initial sketches. By leveraging this information, we can rapidly conceive and develop creative ideas. Additionally, we employ text-to-image generation techniques to achieve controlled generation and editing of architectural rendering images. Throughout our entire system, we can generate a range of visual cues, including architectural plans, elevations, handcrafted model, and architectural renderings, which serves as a wealth of inspiration and provide architects with many creative prompts. Our approach significantly reduces the time required for the initial stages of architectural design while offering boundless possibilities for designers' creativity. ![Image 9: e](https://zrealli.github.io/sketch2arc/images/02.jpg)

### Global generation

Firstly, we generate floorplans and architectural 3D models based on the sketches. Then, we employ the generated architectural models to achieve the end-to-end generation of architectural renderings. This process is controlled by fine-tuned models and textual descriptions, allowing us to integrate various design requirements and obtain the desired preliminary architectural design results. Figure 5 illustrates the overall generated results. The textual descriptions are composed using the architectural design elements in Figure 3 (Architectural styles, types, materials, landscape, renderings..).

### Local editing

we utilize masks to modify specific regions of the generated building, such as material editing, element modifications, and structural changes. Our approach is close to the parametric design. However, instead of using numerical parameters, we employ text prompts as variables and leverage the powerful generative capabilities of large-scale models to perform specific editing operations, providing real-time feedback to architects. As shown in Figure 6, we extensively explore local architectural design edits based on the architectural terms discussed earlier. Our approach allows desired modifications to specific elements while preserving the rest of the architectural rendering unchanged.
