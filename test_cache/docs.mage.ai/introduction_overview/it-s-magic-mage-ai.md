# It’s magic. - Mage AI


Give your data team magical powers.


## Content

Mage is a hybrid framework for transforming and integrating data. It combines the best of both worlds: the flexibility of notebooks with the rigor of modular code.

*   Extract and synchronize data from 3rd party sources.
*   Transform data with real-time and batch pipelines using Python, SQL, and R.
*   Load data into your data warehouse or data lake using our pre-built connectors.
*   Run, monitor, and orchestrate thousands of pipelines without losing sleep.

Plus hundreds of enterprise-class features, infrastructure innovations, and magical surprises.

* * *

**Available in two spellbinding versions**

  

* * *

Getting started
---------------

Get quickly started on building and deploying magical data pipelines by watching a short product video and trying out the interactive demo playground.

🦄 Make data magical
--------------------

We put the _fun_ in fun-ctional programming. Mage is a hybrid framework that combines the best of both worlds: the flexibility of notebooks with the rigor of modular code.

*   **Extract** and synchronize data from 3rd party sources.
*   **Transform** data with real-time and batch pipelines using Python, SQL, and R.
*   **Load** data into your data warehouse or data lake using our pre-built connectors.
*   Run, monitor, and **orchestrate** thousands of pipelines without losing sleep.

| 🚰 | [Streaming](https://docs.mage.ai/guides/streaming) | Ingest and transform real-time data. |
| 🧱 | [dbt](https://docs.mage.ai/guides/dbt) | Build, run, and manage your dbt models with Mage. |

🏔️ [Core design principles](https://docs.mage.ai/design/core-design-principles)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every user experience and technical design decision adheres to these principles.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 💻 | [Easy developer experience](https://docs.mage.ai/design/core-design-principles#easy-developer-experience) | Open-source engine that comes with a custom notebook UI for building data pipelines. |
| 🚢 | [Engineering best practices](https://docs.mage.ai/design/core-design-principles#engineering-best-practices-built-in) | Build and deploy data pipelines using modular code. No more writing throwaway code or trying to turn notebooks into scripts. |
| 💳 | [Data as a first-class citizen](https://docs.mage.ai/design/core-design-principles#data-is-a-first-class-citizen) | Designed from the ground up specifically for running data-intensive workflows. |
| 🪐 | [Scaling made simple](https://docs.mage.ai/design/core-design-principles#scaling-is-made-simple) | Analyze and process large data quickly for rapid iteration. |

🛸 [Core abstractions](https://docs.mage.ai/design/core-abstractions)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the fundamental concepts that Mage uses to operate.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🏢 | [Project](https://docs.mage.ai/design/core-abstractions#project) | Like a repository on GitHub; this is where you write all your code. |
| 🪈 | [Pipeline](https://docs.mage.ai/design/core-abstractions#pipeline) | Contains references to all the blocks of code you want to run, charts for visualizing data, and organizes the dependency between each block of code. |
| 🧱 | [Block](https://docs.mage.ai/design/core-abstractions#block) | A file with code that can be executed independently or within a pipeline. |
| 🤓 | [Data product](https://docs.mage.ai/design/core-abstractions#data-product) | Every block produces data after it’s been executed. These are called data products in Mage. |
| ⏰ | [Trigger](https://docs.mage.ai/design/core-abstractions#trigger) | A set of instructions that determine when or how a pipeline should run. |
| 🏃‍♂️ | [Run](https://docs.mage.ai/design/core-abstractions#run) | Stores information about when it was started, its status, when it was completed, any runtime variables used in the execution of the pipeline or block, etc. |

Individually, we’re a mage.

> 🧙 Mage
> 
> Magic is indistinguishable from advanced technology. A mage is someone who uses magic (aka advanced technology).

Together, we’re Magers!

> 🧙‍♂️🧙 Magers (`/ˈmājər/`)
