Principal Data Scientist at Pixemantic

As a data scientist, I use data every day in every topic and field and think that data can appear in one format to make it easier to use and explore. After I tried the DDC converter, it became the only solution for me to manage and convert all BIM documents. Thanks to DataDrivenConstruction, I can now work with all IFC and Revit files automatically without having to upload files to the server.

Revit and IFC reports that used to take me almost weeks to create are now updated in just a few minutes. I was able to quickly understand what the DataDrivenConstruction did and thus extend and modify it to fit projects.The DataDrivenConstruction team showed me examples of blocks and scripts that can automatically generate PDF, XLSX, and DOCX files that mark errors/defects in the model. Additionally, we also now do automatic checks for IFC structure, file naming, etc.

Great experience: Until now, I used to open IFC files in Blocknote to check the parameters and their structure. Thanks to the DataDrivenConstruction converter I can check the parameters and see their structure directly in MS Excel in an orderly and SMART way, amazing!

### The DDC Excel plugin lets users open and process CAD (BIM) files directly in Excel, eliminating the need for specialized software. It's perfect for small to medium projects (200-400 MB files), while larger datasets are better handled with tools like Jupyter Notebook, Pandas and LLM for advanced analytics.

**Structured DataFrame** is ideal source for today's **processing and analytics tools**
=======================================================================================

### Structured data, organized in columns and rows, has become the backbone of modern storage and analysis systems due to its orderliness and ease of processing.  For example, only one Pandas library, which works with the DataFrame data format, is downloaded about [12 million times a day](https://www.pepy.tech/projects/pandas). Due to its popularity and ease of use, DataFrame (column based Data) has become the primary format for processing and automating data in ChatGPT, LLaMa and other LLM tools. Modern LLMs and data analytics tools almost always default to Python and Pandas for tasks such as data validation, analysis, visualization, and processing.

If "data is the new oil", we need to learn to define it, find it, mine it, refine it, to make it valuable. I've found Artem Boiko's research work, his book, and his posts very informative and insightful. He always provides a useful historical background and plain language explanation to his work. His regular contributions to the BIM Heroes community network help to give our AEC members, who are interested in digital transformation, a good understanding of data - how it works, and how it is structured, and how it can be used. Thanks Artem and DataDrivenConstruction for your continuous effort.

Probably the most interesting book of the last two years that I know of. Required reading to break free from the 'matrix' perpetuated by software vendors, this book delves into how emerging tools like artificial intelligence offer fresh opportunities for data management without extensive technical expertise, poised to revolutionize even the most antiquated sectors like construction.With flawless translation and mind-bending graphics, it's a must-read. Eagerly anticipating the sequel. Very good buy in my opinion...I will read it again and waiting for the second part!

I highly recommend Artem's book that addresses, as the title says, a data driven information management approach for AECO. I am currently using it to help initiate a number of discussions with various groups. I have found it a very accessible reference.As well as a thorough overview of the history context of tools in AECO, data and introducing several key technologies the book contains a number of very useful diagrams, that outline the scope of data sources and end user artefacts, common database types encountered, applications working on that data and output artefacts in organisations or projects, with sample workflows.It strikes me that these are the types of diagrams we need more of when developing and monitoring information strategies and contribute to BEP's - defining the overall enterprise data model onto which the boundary for a PIM and AIM can be overlaid.

📚 I read the book in one breath, in less than 6 hours. The presentation of information is as simple as possible, but for deep perception and coverage of the materials requires an expanded horizon of knowledge from the construction and IT industries. At 270 pages, a huge number of schemes. The manufacturing quality of the book is excellent, dense glossy paper, color schemes, a pleasant font.🏗 The content of the book allows you to look at construction project management from an information management perspective. Will broaden your horizons and understanding of modern digital technologies in construction. The large number of practical examples on how to work with ChatGPT specific to the construction industry will save you months, if not years, of self-study.💻 Work examples are very diverse, ranging from simple to complex, without requiring you to purchase complex and expensive software. The main focus is on open source software. In the book and about data analysis and programming, visualization of information. You will look at Excel and your computer in a different way.👨‍💼 The book will be especially useful for BIM specialists, IT specialists working or going to work in the construction industry. Digital ISU to take a new look at project management, to increase their efficiency. The book will allow owners of any business in the construction industry to take a fresh look at their business strategy, digitalization and development prospects.

The "DATA-DRIVEN CONSTRUCTION" by Artem Boiko is a comprehensive work that fills a gap in the "modern" construction industry.It offers valuable insights into both the basics and advanced applications of data in construction. Artem also presents an interesting approach to handling data in construction and shows how it can be used. It is a successful presentation of the various possibilities that data can offer in construction and provides practical guidance and examples.As such, it is an absolute recommendation for anyone involved in the use of data in the construction industry.

At the moment, the degree of chaotic and oversaturated information in the construction industry has reached such a level that any specialist in the field of working with data would be horrified. But the problem is that builders have long been working in their own closed IT world and often come up with zoned existing approaches or directly ignoring the successful experience of working with data from other industries. Artem Boyko's work is one of the first steps beyond the boundaries of the usual world of builders, with their complex design and management systems, when, it would seem, the complexity and saturation of data does not even give a chance for radical simplification and increased transparency of work with construction data.In his book, Artem shows in simple language what opportunities modern technologies of working with data open before us, and literally gives concrete steps that you can immediately apply in your work. I urge everyone who wants to understand where automation systems will go in the construction industry to study this small book carefully in order to realize that the data revolution in construction is already knocking on our door.It's only of interest to geeks now, but in a few years, like BIM, such approaches and software will be ubiquitous!

I am a civil engineer. I have a PhD in project and construction management. As a civil engineer, in addition to the many construction projects I have realized, I have been involved in the development in the field of AEC since 1987, which Artem Boiko described in BIM history https://bigdataconstruction.com/history-of-bim/. In addition to representing Archtrion, Vectorworks software in Turkey, I have realized the Turkish localization of these software. In partnership with Bentley, I provided sales and training of Bentley's AEC solutions. I produced kitchen design and order automation software called ArchKitchen. In addition to world brands such as Arup, Bayer, Mercedes, Renault, Siemens, Franke, Teka, public institutions of my country and sector leading brands have become my customers. I have produced a lot of software in the field of AEC. When I review the book Data-Driven Construction with the knowledge and experience I have gained in my professional life of more than thirty-five years, I would like to say the following.I would like to start by saying that when you take the Data-Driven Construction book in your hand, you will feel its high quality with its print quality and binding. Most importantly, I should also say that Data-Driven Construction is worthy of being taught as a textbook in universities and is a book that will make valuable contributions to the developing BIM field. Data-Driven Construction contains a technical glossary that explains the concepts very well. The explanation of conceptual and technical terms adds value to the understanding of the text. I think it would be appropriate to develop these sections of the book as a technical glossary.Data-Driven Construction book is supported by visual narration. Topics that are extremely difficult to explain are made simple and understandable with a very beautiful visual language. I think that what is intended to be explained in the visuals should be expressed to the reader, even if briefly. The comprehensibility of some visuals, in other words, reading the visual requires separate information. The book Data-Driven Construction explains very well what is conceptually related to what with its historical background. I would like to suggest that in the development of the book, these narratives should be made comprehensive instead of being a summary.The book Data-Driven Construction has traces of Artem Boiko's education and software development experiences, which increases the gains of the reader. I think that it would be better to relate what is described in the book to Artem Boiko's education and software development with the links to be given and to increase the software examples in case-study style. I must say that the topics of the Data-Driven Construction book are very well structured. I think it would be useful to give information about software development tools in the parts of the book that will guide those who want to work in this field.I think it would be useful to have a section in the Data-Driven Construction book where existing software solutions on the subject are examined. For example, I think it would be useful to explain the operation of a system such as ERP and data relationships to the reader in a short understandable language. In the book Data-Driven Construction, many file and data sharing formats are mentioned. I think it would be useful to provide more detailed information about the content of these formats or to provide the reader with access to detailed information by referring to references.In the Data-Driven Construction book, I think that BIM standard setters such as BuildingSmart, BSI are introduced and the relationship between BIM standards and data should be given in more detail. For example, I think it is a necessity to explain the structure of IFC in the book in great detail.I think that how data is obtained from BIM model information should be exemplified in the book as in Artem Boiko's trainings. Finally, I must say that the Data-Driven Construction book is a very good study on the essence of the subject and each title is open to be developed more comprehensively. I would like to say a few words about Artem Boiko himself.In my PhD study, I argued that Revit-Dynamo software, a visual programming tool, can be used in the calculation of construction costs in an unconventional way. I must say that I am surprised that among the over 10.000 sources I examined for Cost Network Modeling, which I developed in my PhD, only Artem Boiko followed the same approach. I would also like to say that I am happy to introduce Artem Boiko's valuable work in my lectures and seminars at universities. I am happy to know Artem Boiko, a good and valuable person. I wish him continued success.
