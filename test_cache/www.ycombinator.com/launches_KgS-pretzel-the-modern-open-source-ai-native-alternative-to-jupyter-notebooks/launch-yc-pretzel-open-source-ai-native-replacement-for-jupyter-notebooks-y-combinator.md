We're building a better Jupyter notebook for everyone who works with data

We're building a better Jupyter notebook for everyone who works with data

Hey everyone! We're [Prasoon](https://linkedin.com/in/prasoondshukla) and [Ramon](https://linkedin.com/in/ramon-garate-4b379093) from Pretzel AI, and **we're building the modern Jupyter Notebook that fixes many **[**longstanding**](https://medium.com/codex/an-honest-rant-on-why-i-despise-jupyter-notebooks-6b631334ce19)** **[**problems**](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/jupyter-pitfalls/)** with Jupyter.** Pretzel improves on Jupyter with native support for AI tools like GitHub Copilot and LLMs, built-in collaboration (think Google Docs), an IDE-like code-writing experience (think VSCode), native support for SQL _and_ Python, reactivity (so your notebooks are reproducible) and a visual data exploration and dashboarding suite. Best of all, we are fully open-source.

**As our first product**, we‚Äôve built just one feature Pretzel: a visual data exploration tool that runs locally in the browser. See demo below or check us out on [GitHub](https://github.com/pretzelai/pretzelai)!

**‚ùå The Problem with Jupyter Notebooks**
----------------------------------------

Jupyter Notebook started in 2011 as a nicer, interactive way to work in Python. At the time, it was the best interactive tool to work with data really popular! It‚Äôs currently used by _millions_ of data scientists and analysts everyday.

Despite it‚Äôs popularity, **there are many longstanding problems with Jupyter**:

1.  **Notebooks do not reproduce reliably**. Running cells out of order, running them multiple times, and hidden state can lead to inconsistent results.
2.  **Collaboration is difficult**. There's no easy way to work on a notebook with others in real time like you can with Google Docs.
3.  **The code-writing experience is subpar** compared to modern IDEs like VSCode. Features like intelligent autocomplete, linting, debugging, GitHub Copilot support and in-place editing with LLMs are all lacking.
4.  **Integrating with other tools and languages can be clunky**. While Jupyter supports kernels for other languages, you can't seamlessly switch between SQL and Python natively.
5.  **Notebooks are still only usable by technical folks** - i.e., data scientists and analysts. Most non-technical people still prefer using visual tools like Metabase or Tableau for their data needs.

**ü•® The Solution: Introducing Pretzel**
----------------------------------------

We're building Pretzel to address these pain points by building the notebook experience for the modern day. Here's what makes Pretzel special:

1.  **AI-Powered**: Pretzel integrates natively with AI tools like GitHub Copilot and large language models. Get intelligent code suggestions, understand, edit, and generate code right from your notebook.
2.  **Reproducibility**: Pretzel notebooks are reactive, meaning that cells update automatically when their dependencies change. This ensures your notebooks always stay in sync and produce consistent results.
3.  **Collaboration**: With Pretzel, you can collaborate on notebooks in real-time with others, just like in Google Docs. No more emailing notebooks back and forth or dealing with merge conflicts.
4.  **IDE-like Experience**: We're bringing the best parts of modern IDEs to Pretzel. Enjoy intelligent autocomplete, linting, debugging, testing, and more right in your notebook.
5.  **Polyglot**: Pretzel has first-class support for both SQL and Python. Switch seamlessly between languages in the same notebook.
6.  **Open-Source**: We believe in the power of open-source software. It eases adoption significantly (vs paid tools), has strong network effects and best of all, users can build their favorite features and contribute back to the community!

**üí° _What Are We Doing Differently?_**

**Other tools like **[**Hex**](https://hex.tech/)** have tried to fix problems with Jupyter**. While Hex is a _great_ product, it has been unable to displace Jupyter as the de facto data tool. _Why?_ Because **Open Source = Distribution** and closed source tools have failed at distribution.

**With Pretzel, we tap into the same distribution mechanics as Jupyter** to become the new de-facto data tool. With our free and open-source approach:

*   **Way more people are able to try Pretzel** for their work because it's free and self-serve - it can be installed just like Jupyter to run on your local machine without needing to worry about procurement cycles and data-sharing concerns.
*   **Network Effects** come into play. When people contribute code into Pretzel to solve _their_ problems, _everyone_ benefits. The more people that use Pretzel, the more it‚Äôs value.
*   **Enterprises are more willing to try Pretzel** because they're not worried about us going out of business in two years!

We plan to monetize via cloud hosting and enterprise features (like SSO, compute, single-tenancy hosting, local LLM support etc).

**üì£ Ask**
----------

We'd _love_ to get your feedback on Pretzel and the features _you_ would like to see! **Email us at founders \[at\] withpretzel \[dot\] com** or talk to us on [GitHub](https://github.com/pretzelai/pretzelai/issues).

Here‚Äôs a silly photo of us to wrap up the post :)

Happy data wrangling!
