Introducing Glide - a new way to build software with AI

At Agentic Labs, we believe developers shouldn’t have to choose between thoughtfully designing code and shipping quickly.

### Problem

Creating a good technical design makes the implementation 10x easier for most coding tasks, but it’s a slow and manual process. We’ve experienced this at companies like Bridgewater and SpaceX, where reliable and maintainable software is mission-critical.

Conversely, in a startup, you build super fast, but it’s easy to find yourself being **crushed** by the complexity you’ve created because you didn’t have time to write a spec or analyze 3 different approaches.

Until now, you’ve probably had to pick one of these two extremes.

### Solution

We’re building Glide, an AI-first editor purpose-built for writing technical design docs. It integrates with your codebase, saving engineers time on triage, planning, and implementation of complex code changes.

Here’s how you use it:

### 1\. Get started by adding a repo, setting the goal, and attaching code

We’re demonstrating on an open ticket in Vercel’s AI-Chatbot repo

*   **Repo** here: [https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot](https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot)
*   **Goal** was inspired by the ticket here: [https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot/issues/226](https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot/issues/226)
*   **Code** was added that is relevant to the task

### 2\. Triage the task in one click

_Jump-start your thinking._ _Refine and edit in-line._

### 3\. Triage → Plan

_From your triage, generate a step-by-step plan._

### 4\. Plan → Implement

_Once you like the plan, generate detailed code edits._

### 5\. Send to VSCode to complete the change

_Yes, we know, automatic PRs are coming soon._
