What our users say
------------------

Openpipe increased our inference speed by 3x compared to GPT4-turbo while reducing cost by \>10x. It’s a no-brainer for any company that uses LLMs in prod.

#### David Paffenholz

CEO & Co-founder • Juicebox

We used OpenPipe to process a huge dataset we needed classified. GPT-4 would have cost us $60K, but with OpenPipe it was only a few hundred dollars. The process was super simple and results were great. The OpenPipe team is the real deal and really knows their stuff.

#### Sahil Chopra

Co-founder • Linum

InVintory processes millions of wine labels every month, and GPT-4 was prohibitively expensive to continue using. OpenPipe allowed us to train a model that is just as accurate at 1/8th the cost, I’d highly recommend them for fine-tuning task specific models!

OpenPipe has been huge for us! They’ve made it easy and cheap to deploy fine tunes and rapidly iterate on them. We’ve deployed ~10 fine tunes on OpenPipe in the last few months and have been able to ship some big improvements to our quest + inventory features because of them. Their support has also been amazing!

For us, the biggest benefit was lowering time to production. OpenPipe lets us focus on our IP and use the platform to train, review and deploy models in a few clicks with confidence.

#### Alex Rodriguez

Tech Lead • Axis

We’re using OpenPipe to train our custom voice bots. Our fine-tuned models are much lower latency than OpenAI’s, so we’re able to provide a much better user experience for our customers
