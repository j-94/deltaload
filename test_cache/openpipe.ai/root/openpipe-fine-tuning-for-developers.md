# OpenPipe: Fine-Tuning for Developers


Convert expensive LLM prompts into fast, cheap fine-tuned models.


## Content

Fine-tuning for production apps
-------------------------------

#### Train higher-quality, faster models that continuously improve.

To start collecting training data

Higher quality, lower costs
---------------------------

#### Fine-tuned Llama 3.1 models consistently outperform GPT-4o, at a fraction of the cost.

Shorten your deployment loop. Save time and money.
--------------------------------------------------

#### Keep your datasets, models and evaluations in one place.

### Capture Data

Automatically record LLM requests and responses.

### Train Models

Two clicks to train a state-of-the-art model on your data.

### Automate Deployment

We serve your model on our managed endpoints that scale to millions of requests.

### Evaluate & Compare

Use LLM-as-judge evals to quickly gauge performance.

Get the best model, every time
------------------------------

#### Train, evaluate, and deploy models from every ecosystem, all in the same place.

What our users say
------------------

Openpipe increased our inference speed by 3x compared to GPT4-turbo while reducing cost by \>10x. It’s a no-brainer for any company that uses LLMs in prod.

#### David Paffenholz

CEO & Co-founder • Juicebox

We used OpenPipe to process a huge dataset we needed classified. GPT-4 would have cost us $60K, but with OpenPipe it was only a few hundred dollars. The process was super simple and results were great. The OpenPipe team is the real deal and really knows their stuff.

#### Sahil Chopra

Co-founder • Linum

InVintory processes millions of wine labels every month, and GPT-4 was prohibitively expensive to continue using. OpenPipe allowed us to train a model that is just as accurate at 1/8th the cost, I’d highly recommend them for fine-tuning task specific models!

OpenPipe has been huge for us! They’ve made it easy and cheap to deploy fine tunes and rapidly iterate on them. We’ve deployed ~10 fine tunes on OpenPipe in the last few months and have been able to ship some big improvements to our quest + inventory features because of them. Their support has also been amazing!

For us, the biggest benefit was lowering time to production. OpenPipe lets us focus on our IP and use the platform to train, review and deploy models in a few clicks with confidence.

#### Alex Rodriguez

Tech Lead • Axis

We’re using OpenPipe to train our custom voice bots. Our fine-tuned models are much lower latency than OpenAI’s, so we’re able to provide a much better user experience for our customers

#### Fine-tune the right way

[Get Started](https://app.openpipe.ai/)

#### Easy Integration

Simply update your SDK import statement and add an OpenPipe API key. Replace prompts with models in minutes, not weeks.

#### Own Your Weights

Own your own weights when you fine-tune open-source models and deploy anywhere you need.

### OpenAI’s Reinforcement Fine-Tuning: Less Data, Better Results

We perform a technical deep-dive of OpenAI's new RFT and investigate the types of tasks for which it is a major breakthrough.

### RL and $4.80 GPU Time vs 5M HN Posts (RLHF Part 1)

We used reinforcement learning and $4.80 of GPU time to find the best HN post ever.

### We Raised $6.7M to Replace GPT-4 with Custom Models

Today I'm excited to announce the close of our $6.7M seed round.
