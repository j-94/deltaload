# Product – Iris.ai RSpace™ - Your Researcher Workspace


AI for scientific text understanding - Smart search, reading list analysis, auto-generated summaries, data extraction, chatbot with references.


## Content

TRANSFORMATION  
OF EXPERT KNOWLEDGE

The RSpace™ platform and its underlying engineering infrastructure will radically change how you work with expert documentation - external and internal. Transform millions of complex pieces of information into actionable deep knowledge with RSpace™.

RSpace™

Core

Our RSpace™ platform is a powerful AI based tool suite where the user is in control of both workflows and content. Exploratory searches, context filters, summaries, data set analysis, extraction of table data and chat conversations with the document content - the features allow flexible workflows for challenges ranging from product development to competitive intelligence to regulatory affairs.

RSpace™

Enterprise

With the starting point in the RSpace™ toolsuite, our enterprise product offers a range of configuration options. Ingesting hundreds of thousands of internal documents of a variety of file types, fine-tuning or adaptation of models, advanced security measures including private cloud or on-premise deployment, systematizing of key insights and facts, and integrations with your current tools.

RSpace™

Infrastructure

Building RSpace™ for research documentation has required an extraordinary level of robustness, security and scalability of our underlying engineering. We offer a collection of API services for AI developers including but not limited to our RAG-as-a-Service. Our infrastructure offerings can also be deployed on private cloud environments or on-premise.

Unlock insights

The RSpace™ product suite offers a range of possibilities for transforming static information in millions of documents into actionable insights.

#### GET AN OVERVIEW OF YOUR UNIQUE SET OF DATA.

#### Quick.

You are fully in control of what content you use, and on that content you can apply tools to rapidly understand what you have in front of you.

1 5

#### Focus on the right content with machine aid.

#### Simple.

Narrow down your document sets from millions to precisely what you need with smart tools going above and beyond keywords.

2 5

#### Draw out insights through interrogation.

#### Engaging.

The days of skimming page after page for the right nugget of information are gone. Interrogate your data set to unlock the insights you need.

3 5

#### Organize the facts.

#### Automatic.

Ever wished every research paper and patent would use exactly the same structure, unit and naming for their data? Well, now they do.

4 5

#### Lean back to wait for updates.

#### Convenient.

When the tools are smart, vocabulary changes over time is no challenge. Automatic monitoring for new publications has never been easier.

Built for R&D, our products are robust, precise and secure.

Comprehensive content

The RSpace™ is content agnostic, and allows for ingestion and processing of a variety of knowledge sources - external as well as internal.

Privacy and security

No data leaves your instance, whether on cloud or premise. No third party AI providers are involved. We handle your core IP with utmost care.

Grounded in facts

Research demands rigorous attention to facts and no room for hallucinations. Fine tuned LLMs enriched with extracted data in knowledge graphs.

Full process control

End users create their own workflows to ensure reproducibility, explainability and transparency.

Data set enrichment

Massive data sets can be processed to get more helpful titles, summaries, tags, metadata and data point references.

Sustainable and efficient

Large Language Models are great - where needed. We use smarter, not larger, language models where they suffice. Better for pricing and for the environment.

The RSpace_tm_ product suite was built for science - the deepest knowledge of all - and scalable across expert topics, content types and industries.

For R&D or compliance teams, enterprise knowledge management or AI developers - we have solutions that fit your needs.
