Your playable,  
shareable 3D canvas.
=====================================

#### Validate creative ideas before you code. Build out scenes and prototypes that are instantly accessible anywhere, anytime — and on any platform.

Focus on the concept before the code
====================================

Bring your ideas to life with the Editor

The Editor unites process and prototype to streamline your design workflow so you can iterate and test in real-time. No code needed.

Make them interactive and playable

Link up interactions in a visual interface to _feel_ your ideas in their intended platforms and immediately edit them with ease.

Share the designs and create together

Collaborate and communicate in a flexible, web-based design canvas to ensure everyone is on the same page: one file, one hand-off, one source of truth.

    Michele C.
    
    UX Designer @ Omnium
    
    Just discovered Bezi, and I have to say: this is the tool I've been searching for!! I've worked on 3D game projects using Figma, Gravity Sketch, and Unity, but Bezi appears to be the game changer!

    Designer @ Amazon Lab126
    
    I wish Bezi existed five years ago when I started designing XR experiences! An interactive prototype is worth a thousand storyboard sketches. With Bezi, we're speeding up concepts and making more & better iterations!

    Bezi is such a gift for rapid prototyping in 3D 😍🥰 no code, no Unity, no troubleshooting. Just connected with your designer mindset!

    Etienne G.
    
    Researcher @ OICL
    
    Bezi radically simplifies our 3D prototyping pipeline by removing the need for a game engine to generate VR ready scenes, and adds a whole new layer of collaborative features in the process.

    Bezi is literally Figma for 3D. The future is now.

    Karen S.
    
    Founder @ Old Hara Studios
    
    I love Bezi - it's revolutionized how I work with clients! I used to have to chat in Slack and upload 3D scenes from Unity to Github in order for a client to test, Bezi eliminated all of that.

    At Nuro, we strive to improve the 3D design process to be more collaborative and inclusive. We love how Bezi makes it easy to create and share ideas with other designers and engineers.

    Dilmer V.
    
    Founder @ LearnXR
    
    If you are looking to get into XR as a designer or even a programmer then check out Bezi which will allow you to quickly prototype an amazing XR experience that works with multiple platforms (AR/VR)!

    Simon D.
    
    Designer @ Vard
    
    If you are just getting started I would give Bezi a shot. It lets you prototype without actually learning code or having to deal with downloading the right packages etc. As a designer, using RealityKit has been very challenging.

    Jess L.
    
    Sr. Designer @ Google Lens
    
    Bezi makes it so easy to iterate and test. You can have people interact with your design and give feedback, which makes the whole design process faster to validate. Instant preview in VR simply with a URL is so exciting.

I've worked on 3D game projects using Figma, Gravity Sketch, and Unity, but Bezi appears to be the game changer!\n    \n*   ![Image 152](https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZOBVbcei4dzqvmwZcDwjTaR1Dg.jpg)\n    \n    Ruby C.\n    \n    Designer @ Amazon Lab126\n    \n    I wish Bezi existed five years ago when I started designing XR experiences! An interactive prototype is worth a thousand storyboard sketches. With Bezi, we're speeding up concepts and making more & better iterations!\n    \n*   ![Image 153](https://framerusercontent.com/images/bzFubaRZK95GjRmneMLNaXbHrU.jpg)\n    \n    Simon F.\n    \n    Designer @ Doublepoint\n    \n    Bezi is such a gift for rapid prototyping in 3D 😍🥰 no code, no Unity, no troubleshooting.
