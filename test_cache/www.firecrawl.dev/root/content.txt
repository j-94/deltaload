Frequently asked questions about Firecrawl

What is Firecrawl?Firecrawl turns entire websites into clean, LLM-ready markdown or structured data. Scrape, crawl and extract the web with a single API. Ideal for AI companies looking to empower their LLM applications with web data.

What sites work?Firecrawl is best suited for business websites, docs and help centers. We currently don't support social media platforms.

Who can benefit from using Firecrawl?Firecrawl is tailored for LLM engineers, data scientists, AI researchers, and developers looking to harness web data for training machine learning models, market research, content aggregation, and more. It simplifies the data preparation process, allowing professionals to focus on insights and model development.

Is Firecrawl open-source?Yes, it is. You can check out the repository on GitHub. Keep in mind that this repository is currently in its early stages of development. We are in the process of merging custom modules into this mono repository.

What is the difference between Firecrawl and other web scrapers?Firecrawl is designed with reliability and AI-ready data in mind. We focus on delivering data reliably and in a LLM-ready format - so you can spend less tokens and build better AI applications.

What is the difference between the open-source version and the hosted version?Firecrawl's hosted version features Fire-engine which is our proprietary scraper that takes care of proxies, anti-bot mechanisms and more.

The hosted version also allows for actions (interacting with the page before scraping), a dashboard for analytics, and it is 1 API call away.

#### Scraping & Crawling

How does Firecrawl handle dynamic content on websites?Unlike traditional web scrapers, Firecrawl is equipped to handle dynamic content rendered with JavaScript. It ensures comprehensive data collection from all accessible subpages, making it a reliable tool for scraping websites that rely heavily on JS for content delivery.

Why is it not crawling all the pages?There are a few reasons why Firecrawl may not be able to crawl all the pages of a website. Some common reasons include rate limiting, and anti-scraping mechanisms, disallowing the crawler from accessing certain pages. If you're experiencing issues with the crawler, please reach out to our support team at help@firecrawl.com.

Can Firecrawl crawl websites without a sitemap?Yes, Firecrawl can access and crawl all accessible subpages of a website, even in the absence of a sitemap. This feature enables users to gather data from a wide array of web sources with minimal setup.

What formats can Firecrawl convert web data into?Firecrawl specializes in converting web data into clean, well-formatted markdown. This format is particularly suited for LLM applications, offering a structured yet flexible way to represent web content.

How does Firecrawl ensure the cleanliness of the data?Firecrawl employs advanced algorithms to clean and structure the scraped data, removing unnecessary elements and formatting the content into readable markdown. This process ensures that the data is ready for use in LLM applications without further preprocessing.

Is Firecrawl suitable for large-scale data scraping projects?Absolutely. Firecrawl offers various pricing plans, including a Scale plan that supports scraping of millions of pages. With features like caching and scheduled syncs, it's designed to efficiently handle large-scale data scraping and continuous updates, making it ideal for enterprises and large projects.

Does it respect robots.txt?Yes, Firecrawl crawler respects the rules set in a website's robots.txt file. If you notice any issues with the way Firecrawl interacts with your website, you can adjust the robots.txt file to control the crawler's behavior. Firecrawl user agent name is 'FirecrawlAgent'. If you notice any behavior that is not expected, please let us know at help@firecrawl.com.

What measures does Firecrawl take to handle web scraping challenges like rate limits and caching?Firecrawl is built to navigate common web scraping challenges, including stealth proxies, rate limits, and smart wait. It smartly manages requests and employs techniques to minimize bandwidth usage and avoid triggering anti-scraping mechanisms, ensuring reliable data collection.

Does Firecrawl handle captcha or authentication?Firecrawl avoids captcha by using stealth proxies. When it encounters captcha, it attempts to solve it automatically, but this is not always possible. We are working to add support for more captcha solving methods. Firecrawl can handle authentication by providing auth headers to the API.
