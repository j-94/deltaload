[Adding linter and formatter pre-commit hooks for staged BE files](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/commit/d4957af14205d9afeaab3a013bf4ecaafbea9f87 "Adding linter and formatter pre-commit hooks for staged BE files
* Adding linter and formatter to staged BE files.
Note that `.cljfmt/indents.clj` tries to capture our indent rules
and, so far, seems to get things right. There are still some inconsistencies
in some of our nses in how we indent assoc(-in) and some t2 functions
when it comes to key-value pairs on following lines. Should the keys
align with the function call or be indented. Aesthetically, people
seem to like indents, but these are functions, so should align with the
first argument. IDK that it really matters as long as we have agreement.
We may, as we adopt this, have some files be reformatted in unexpected ways
for items that have been missed. If so, the developer can simply update
the .cljfmt/indents.clj file, rerun the hook, and commit that along with
their other changes.
* Added whitespace linter.
* Updating husky commit hook
* Updated hook scripts to be exclusively for staged files.
Updated cljfmt to use the latest and greatest along with the new format of config file.
* Commenting out the actual formatting hook in .husky/pre-commit until we come up with a globally happy solution to forms that don't have good formatting rules, like defprotocol+ in a reader conditional.
* Reverting formatting
* Moving pre-commit hooks from .husky/pre-commit to the package.json's lint-staged section.
Note that we're still not calling the cljfmt file (.bin/cljfmt_staged.sh)
until we get agreement on formatting.
One thing we might do since we're using lint-staged is we can probably
exclude the \"bad\" files that go sideways with linting and format everything
else automatically. This might be a good follow-on PR.")

Sometimes you’ll make a change to some code and not want to commit it.

If you’ve ever done this you’ve probably also committed something you didn’t mean to commit. I know I have.
Below is a git pre-commit hook that searches for the text `nocommit` and if found rejects the commit. With it you can stick `nocommit` in a comment next to the change you don’t want committed and know that it won’t be committed.

* Enable Postgres driver to use secrets for configuring SSL parameters
Adding secret related properties for SSL options to Postgres driver
Move `conn-props->secret-props-by-name` to secret.clj since it's needed directly there, too
Add `us-east-2-bundle.pem` to `test-resources/certificates` for testing Postgres with SSL connectivity to our RDS instance (and a README.md explaining how it differs from the existing `ssl` directory)
Updating `value->file!` to have better logic for building the error message when the existing file is not found (for better UX from the Database admin page)
Updating frontend to support the `visible-if` value being an array, in which case any value may match the current details value, in order for that field to be visible
Adding secret related properties for SSL options to Postgres driver
Updating CircleCI config.yml to refer to the RDS instance when running Postgres SSL test
Implement server side expansion of transitive visible-if dependency chain
Update shouldShowEngineProvidedField on client to consider multiple key/value pairs in the visible-if map, and only show the field if ALL are true
Adding new test to confirm transitive visible-if resolution, and cycle detection
Add Cypress test for SSL field visibility")

[Enable ClojureScript REPL and hot reloading of CLJS code (](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/commit/8e298158a4a8ad5bb47f07da4ba3cbedc3a47a5c "Enable ClojureScript REPL and hot reloading of CLJS code (#34007)
This also moves the CLJS output out of `frontend/src/cljs{,_release}` to
`target/cljs_{dev,release}`. If that causes problems for FE tooling I
don't know about, it could be moved back.
Hot reloading:
CLJS changes are hot-reloaded into the running app by Shadow CLJS - no
action is needed. Note that the UI will not refresh; you usually have to
click around so the updated MLv2 code gets executed.
Usage of the CLJS REPL:
- Open the browser (you should see `shadow-cljs: #N ready!` in console)
- Connect to nrepl on 50655
- \"Select\" the `:app` build;
- https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_editor_integration
- Conjure: `:ConjureShadowSelect app`
- Plain REPL: Eval in CLJ mode `(shadow/repl :app)`
- Consider running `yarn build-hot:cljs` and `yarn build-hot:js` in
separate terminals; then when `yarn build-hot:js` crashes you don't
have to reconnect your REPL.
- The REPL works beautifully, even loading files outside the :entries
of the shadow-cljs build like tests!
\"Stale\" error in browser:
- This can happen if the webpack bundle is created before the CLJS is
done building.
- If you ran `yarn build-hot:cljs` and `:js` separately, let `:cljs`
finish compiling first.
- If you see this otherwise: (a) contact Braden so it can be fixed; and
(b) either restart `build-hot:js` or force webpack to rebuild by
hitting http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/invalidate
Yarn commands:
`dev`, `dev-ee`, `build-hot`, and `build-static-viz:watch` all now wait
for the CLJS build to be complete by watching for files to be generated.
They should work the same from a user's POV.
(Since the webpack build no longer watches the CLJS output,
it won't notice the changes and immediately rebuild after the first
build. This avoids errors on the clean build, or \"stale build\" messages
in the app from Shadow CLJS.)

Get started
-----------

[](https://github.com/metabase/metabase?screenshot=true#get-started)

The easiest way to get started with Metabase is to sign up for a free trial of [Metabase Cloud](https://store.metabase.com/checkout). You get support, backups, upgrades, an SMTP server, SSL certificate, SoC2 Type 2 security auditing, and more (plus your money goes toward improving Metabase). Check out our quick overview of [cloud vs self-hosting](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/cloud/cloud-vs-self-hosting). If you need to, you can always switch to [self-hosting](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/installation-and-operation/installing-metabase) Metabase at any time (or vice versa).

Features
--------

[](https://github.com/metabase/metabase?screenshot=true#features)

Quick Setup: Dev environment
----------------------------

[](https://github.com/metabase/metabase?screenshot=true#quick-setup-dev-environment)

In order to spin up a development environment, you need to start the front end and the backend as follows:

### Frontend quick setup

[](https://github.com/metabase/metabase?screenshot=true#frontend-quick-setup)

The following command will install the Javascript dependencies:

```
$ yarn install
```

To build and run without watching changes:

```
$ yarn build
```

To build and run with hot-reload:

```
$ yarn build-hot
```

### Backend quick setup

[](https://github.com/metabase/metabase?screenshot=true#backend--quick-setup)

In order to run the backend, you'll need to build the drivers first, and then start the backend:

```
$ ./bin/build-drivers.sh
$ clojure -M:run
```

For a more detailed setup of a dev environment for Metabase, check out our [Developers Guide](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/blob/master/docs/developers-guide/start.md).

Internationalization
--------------------

[](https://github.com/metabase/metabase?screenshot=true#internationalization)

We want Metabase to be available in as many languages as possible. See which translations are available and help contribute to internationalization using our project over at [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/join/project/ynjQmwSsGh). You can also check out our [policies on translations](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/administration-guide/localization.html).

Extending Metabase
------------------

Hit our Query API from Javascript to integrate analytics. Metabase enables your application to:

*   Build moderation interfaces.
*   Export subsets of your users to third party marketing automation software.
*   Provide a custom customer lookup application for the people in your company.
