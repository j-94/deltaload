[feat(core): support compile to wasi target (](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/commit/981eb30a0f71cf343361e1430648ecbd46fd29fe "feat(core): support compile to wasi target (#22870)
This pull request is trying to add wasm32-wasi target support for the
nx/native
To test the build, you can run the following commands:
- `rustup target add wasm32-wasip1-threads`
- `pnpm exec napi build --release --platform --package-json-path
packages/nx/package.json --manifest-path packages/nx/Cargo.toml --js
./native-bindings.js -o packages/nx/src/native --target
wasm32-wasip1-threads`
And the wasm file will be built at
packages/nx/src/native/nx.wasm32-wasi.wasm
Blocked by:
- Support @napi-rs/cli 3.0  Cammisuli/monodon#48
- https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs/issues/2009
The pseudo_terminal mod is excluded on the wasm32 targets, which is as
expected.
The watch mod is excluded because of the upstream `watchexec` deps
introduced by ignore-files don't support the wasi target at this moment
(but we can improve it).

[docs(misc): update generator examples to use new directory/path posit…](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/commit/8fa7065cf14df6a90896442f90659b00baa1b5b9 "docs(misc): update generator examples to use new directory/path positional args (#28144)
This PR updates examples in `.md` files (both docs and blog posts) to
use positional args. Nx 20 changes the position arg to be either
`directory` for apps/libs or `path` for artifacts (e.g. components).
So before you'd do this:
```
nx g app myapp --directory=apps/myapp
nx g lib mylib --directory=libs/mylib
nx g lib mylib --directory=libs/nested/mylib
nx g lib @acme/foo --directory=libs/@acme/foo --importPath=@acme/foo
nx g component foo --directory=libs/ui/src/foo --pascalCaseFiles
```
Will now be simplified to
```
nx g app apps/myapp
nx g lib libs/mylib
nx g lib libs/nested/mylib
nx g lib libs/@acme/foo # name and import path are both \"@acme/foo\"
nx g component libs/ui/src/foo/Foo
```
For cases where `name` and `importPath` need to be changed, you can
always manually specify them.
```
nx g lib libs/nested/foo # name is foo
nx g lib libs/nested/foo --name=nested-foo # specify name with prefix
nx g lib libs/@acme/foo --name # use \"foo\" as name and don't match importPath
nx g lib libs/@internal/foo --importPath=@acme/foo # different importPath from name
<!-- If this is a particularly complex change or feature addition, you can request a dedicated Nx release for this pull request branch. Mention someone from the Nx team or the `@nrwl/nx-pipelines-reviewers` and they will confirm if the PR warrants its own release for testing purposes, and generate it for you if appropriate. -->

This pull request is trying to add wasm32-wasi target support for the
nx/native
To test the build, you can run the following commands:
- `rustup target add wasm32-wasip1-threads`
- `pnpm exec napi build --release --platform --package-json-path
packages/nx/package.json --manifest-path packages/nx/Cargo.toml --js
./native-bindings.js -o packages/nx/src/native --target
wasm32-wasip1-threads`
And the wasm file will be built at
packages/nx/src/native/nx.wasm32-wasi.wasm
Blocked by:
- Support @napi-rs/cli 3.0  Cammisuli/monodon#48
- https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs/issues/2009
The pseudo_terminal mod is excluded on the wasm32 targets, which is as
expected.
The watch mod is excluded because of the upstream `watchexec` deps
introduced by ignore-files don't support the wasi target at this moment
(but we can improve it).

packages/nx/package.json --manifest-path packages/nx/Cargo.toml --js
./native-bindings.js -o packages/nx/src/native --target
wasm32-wasip1-threads`
And the wasm file will be built at
packages/nx/src/native/nx.wasm32-wasi.wasm
Blocked by:
- Support @napi-rs/cli 3.0  Cammisuli/monodon#48
- https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs/issues/2009
The pseudo_terminal mod is excluded on the wasm32 targets, which is as
expected.
The watch mod is excluded because of the upstream `watchexec` deps
introduced by ignore-files don't support the wasi target at this moment
(but we can improve it).

Smart Monorepos · Fast CI
=========================

[](https://github.com/nrwl/nx?screenshot=true#smart-monorepos--fast-ci)

Nx is a build system, optimized for monorepos, with plugins for popular frameworks and tools and advanced CI capabilities including caching and distribution.

Create a new Nx workspace with

```shell
npx create-nx-workspace
```

...or run

```
npx nx init
```

to add Nx to your existing workspace to get faster task scheduling, caching and more. More [in the docs](https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro#try-nx-yourself).

Learn about CI with Nx Cloud
----------------------------

[](https://github.com/nrwl/nx?screenshot=true#learn-about-ci-with-nx-cloud)

[Nx Cloud](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud) connects directly to your existing CI setup, helping you scale your monorepos on CI by leveraging [remote caching](https://nx.dev/ci/features/remote-cache?utm_source=nxrepo&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nxrepo), [task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/ci/features/distribute-task-execution?utm_source=nxrepo&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nxrepo), [automated e2e test splitting](https://nx.dev/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks?utm_source=nxrepo&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nxrepo) and [automated task flakiness detection](https://nx.dev/ci/features/flaky-tasks?utm_source=nxrepo&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nxrepo)

Connect your existing Nx workspace with

```
npx nx connect
```

Learn more in the [Nx CI docs »](https://nx.dev/ci/intro?utm_source=nxrepo&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nxrepo)
