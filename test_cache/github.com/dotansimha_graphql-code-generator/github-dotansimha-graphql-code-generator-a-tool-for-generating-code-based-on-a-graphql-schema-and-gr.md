[Trigger rebuilds in watch mode while respecting rules of precedence a…](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/commit/2a5da589468eb5970587187adae9892ff1f13134 "Trigger rebuilds in watch mode while respecting rules of precedence and negation (#9275)
* chore: Add two new `dev-test/star-wars` queries which can be excluded by micromatch patterns
This commit adds `ExcludeQueryAlpha` and `ExcludeQueryBeta`, and then
checks them in along with the result of running `yarn generate:examples`,
since this should be the baseline of the unmodified codegen.
A separate commit will add some new outputs to the `star-wars`
example that alternately exclude and include these files, in order
to test pattern matching works with both generating and watching
the files.
* chore: Add `dev-test/types.excludeQuery{Alpha,Beta}.ts` for exclusion baseline testing
This commit adds a baseline for testing pattern matching with
contravariant negations between two config stanzas. That is,
the `types.excludeQueryAlpha.ts` target produces an output
that includes `ExcludeQueryBeta` but not `ExcludeQueryAlpha`,
and the `types.excludeQueryBeta.ts` target produces an output
that includes `ExcludeQueryAlpha` but not `ExcludeQueryBeta`.
Manual verification shows that the output files correctly exclude these types
when running generation, and so they can be checked in as a baseline for later
tests to detect a regression if that changes.
Otherwise, they'll be used primarily for testing `yarn watch:examples`, which
we expect will adhere to the same exclusion rules during _generation_, but
which we need to make ure also adheres to those rules during watch mode, while
filtering file change events to trigger (or not trigger) rebuilds.
* chore: Add `nothing-should-use-this-query.graphql`
Add a file in `dev-test-outer-dir` which is excluded by the pattern that's part
of a pattern set otherwise matching `*.graphql` files in that directory. This
way, we can check that touching this file does not ever trigger a rebuild
during watch mode (and also note that this commits shows it's not included in
any output during generation).
In fact, the bug we're fixing in watch mode is so sensitive that we can simply
run `git status` to trigger a change to the Git `index.lock`, but this way at
least we have a real `*.graphql` file we can touch and watch for avoidance of
rebuild triggers.
* fix(watch): Remove double-concatenated `fullPath`, since `path` is already absolute
Parcel Watcher always provides `path` as an absolute path (see the readme for
the package), and we were incorrectly concatenating it with absolute path
`watchDirectory` (and prior to #9270, with `process.cwd()`, which is also an
absolute path).
This removes the concatenation, which should fix a potential bug when comparing
to `config.configFilePath`. However, it also means that since #9050, we've been
passing an absolute path to the `onWatchTriggered` hook, which may or may not
be expected by downstream user code. This commit leaves that unchanged, and we
still pass it an absolute path.
* fix(watch): Respect negation and precedence when triggering rebuilds
Implement the algorithm for deciding when to trigger a rebuild
during watch mode, in such a way that precedence (both in terms
of global config preceding per-target config, and in terms of
watch patterns preceding document/schema patterns) is respected,
and negations are evaluated within their local groups.
This algorithm is described and diagrammed here:
https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/issues/9270#issuecomment-1496765045
* chore(tests): Return `stopWatching` callback from `createWatcher`
Make `createWatcher` more testable, by returning a `stopWatching` callback that
can be called to stop the otherwise infinitely running watcher. Implement it by
adding an abort signal handler to the existing process.exit and SIGINT
handlers, to call `shutdown()` in the same way.
* Add mocking infrastructure for `createWatcher` and `@parcel/watcher`
Create mocking infrastructure for the watcher, including mocking
`@parcel/watcher`, so that tests can dispatch file change events
and spy on the subscription callback.
* fix(watcher): Improve watcher shutdown precision, add more tests
This commit implements graceful shutdown for the watcher, including
when cancelled via an AbortSignal. It also includes a polyfill for
AbortController, which is necessary on Node v14 (at least without
passing any experimental flags).
Shutdown events happen in logical order, and as long as the caller
does `await stopRunning()`, it's guaranteed the promise will only
resolve after the watch server has terminated completely.
* chore(tests): Add helpers for asserting whether multiple files triggered rebuild
Add a helper function that takes a mock watcher, a list of files that
should trigger rebuild, and a list of files that should not trigger
rebuild, and then automatically tests all of them.
Call the `expect()` functions with an assertion helper that ensures
the stack trace shows the relevant functon call, and also adds a
formatted prelude clearly showing which path was expected to trigger
or not trigger a rebuild, and what happened instead.
* fix(watcher): Convert ParcelWatcher ignore paths to be relative to watchDirectory
ParcelWatcher expects the `ParcelWatcher.Options[\"ignore\"]` array
to include either absolute paths, or relative paths that are relative
to the `watchDirectory`. This commit fixes a bug where the paths
of ignored files (i.e., output directories from stanzas with presetConfig)
were relative to `process.cwd()`, which may differ from `watchDirectory`
* chore(tests): Add assertions for ParcelWatcher.Options.ignore, and refactor
Add mocks, assertion helpers, and error formatters for testing
the value of paths and globs passed to the `options[\"ignore\"]`
argument of `parcelWatcher.subscribe()`.
Note that we can't properly mock the behavior of this, because
ParcelWatcher implements its ignore logic in C++, so the best we
can do is make assertions on the argument it receives.
This commit also refactors all of the watch mode testing infrastructure
to be in a `tests/watch-helpers` directory.
* chore(tests): Fix some typos, namely preferring \"relative from\" vs. \"relative to\"
The \"relative from\" nomenclature matches how NodeJS docs refer to
the concept of one path being relative from another, and in the case
of changes to comments, also matches the actual variable names which
were already using `from` instead of `to`
* fix(watcher): Ignore negated patterns when picking watchDirectory
When picking `watchDirectory` by finding the \"longest common prefix directory\"
of all paths and glob patterns, only include affirmative (non-negated)
patterns. Otherwise, a rule like `!**/never.graphql` will cause
the `watchDirectory` to always be `process.cwd()`, because the
result of `mm.scan(\"!**/never.graphql\").base` is `\"\"`.
* fix(watcher): Fix logic error in negation precedence, and add more test cases
Remove `pathMatches` shortcut in favor of explicitly checking for negation
after finding an affirmative match, because it turns out this doesn't
work. Now the code exactly matches the flow chart.
The reason for this change is that micromatch does not give negation
priority when there is an exact affirmative match, but we expect it to
(because in our case, negations _always_ take precedence). The micromatch
behavior makes sense when you're considering one set of patterns, because
why would you both include and exclude an exact path? But we have the
additional complexity of mixing global and local pattern sets, so we can
naturally arrive at a situation where a set includes both an exact negated
match, and an exact affirmative match. In this case we still want to negate it.
Without this fix, the logic was not working as expected, because a global
negation was being ignored when there was a local inclusion.
* chore(watcher): Add isolated test for each case in addition to combined one
For each individual assertion we were making in the big combined config,
isolate it into a single test that captures the important aspect of it,
and also add some more specificity to the logic of some of the assertions,
which is much easier to see when isolated within a single test.
This should make it easier to identify the source of any future regressions.
Still, keep the existing test with the big combined config, because it
can't hurt. But change \"foo\" to \"fuzz\" in that test, just to create
different strings in case someone wants to grep for a path in a failing
individual test.
* fix(watcher): Import `AbortController` from `@whatwg-node/fetch`
There is no need for a poly/pony-fill.
* Revert \"fix(watcher): Import `AbortController` from `@whatwg-node/fetch`\"
This reverts commit 7a374c27ef7d1f1f02531b7395ff3d37ce12fa31.
There is some issue with the implementation of `AbortController`
in `@whatwg-node/fetch` which causes all the tests to timeout (presumably
because the `AbortSignal` is either not being emitted or received).")

GraphQL Code Generator is a tool that generates code out of your GraphQL schema. Whether you are developing a frontend or backend, you can utilize GraphQL Code Generator to generate output from your GraphQL Schema and GraphQL Documents (query/mutation/subscription/fragment).

By analyzing the schema and documents and parsing it, GraphQL Code Generator can output code at a wide variety of formats, based on pre-defined templates or based on custom user-defined ones. Regardless of the language that you're using, GraphQL Code Generator has you covered.

GraphQL Code Generator lets you choose the output that you need, based on _plugins_, which are very flexible and customizable. You can also write your _plugins_ to generate custom outputs that match your needs.

You can try this tool live on your browser and see some useful examples. Check out [GraphQL Code Generator Live Examples](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/#live-demo).

We currently support and maintain [these plugins](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins) (TypeScript, Flow, React, Angular, MongoDB, Stencil, Reason, and some more), and there is an active community that writes and maintains custom plugins.

Quick Start
-----------

[](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator?screenshot=true#quick-start)

> You can find the complete instructions in [GraphQL Code Generator website](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/docs/getting-started/installation).

Start by installing the basic deps of GraphQL Codegen:

```shell
yarn add graphql
yarn add -D @graphql-codegen/cli
```

GraphQL Code Generator lets you setup everything by simply running the following command:

```shell
yarn graphql-codegen init
```

Question by question, it will guide you through the whole process of setting up a schema, selecting plugins, picking a destination of a generated file, and a lot more.

If you wish to [manually setup codegen, follow these instructions](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/docs/getting-started/installation).

watch mode while respecting rules of precedence and negation (#9275)\n* chore: Add two new `dev-test/star-wars` queries which can be excluded by micromatch patterns\nThis commit adds `ExcludeQueryAlpha` and `ExcludeQueryBeta`, and then\nchecks them in along with the result of running `yarn generate:examples`,\nsince this should be the baseline of the unmodified codegen.\nA separate commit will add some new outputs to the `star-wars`\nexample that alternately exclude and include these files, in order\nto test pattern matching works with both generating and watching\nthe files.\n* chore: Add `dev-test/types.excludeQuery{Alpha,Beta}.ts` for exclusion baseline testing\nThis commit adds a baseline for testing pattern matching with\ncontravariant negations between two config stanzas. That is,\nthe `types.excludeQueryAlpha.ts` target produces an output\nthat includes `ExcludeQueryBeta` but not `ExcludeQueryAlpha`,\nand the `types.excludeQueryBeta.ts` target produces an output\nthat includes `ExcludeQueryAlpha` but not `ExcludeQueryBeta`.\nManual verification shows that the output files correctly exclude these types\nwhen running generation, and so they can be checked in as a baseline for later\ntests to detect a regression if that changes.\nOtherwise, they'll be used primarily for testing `yarn watch:examples`, which\nwe expect will adhere to the same exclusion rules during _generation_, but\nwhich we need to make ure also adheres to those rules during watch mode, while\nfiltering file change events to trigger (or not trigger) rebuilds.\n* chore: Add `nothing-should-use-this-query.graphql`\nAdd a file in `dev-test-outer-dir` which is excluded by the pattern that's part\nof a pattern set otherwise matching `*.graphql` files in that directory. This\nway, we can check that touching this file does not ever trigger a rebuild\nduring watch mode (and also note that this commits shows it's not included in\nany output during generation).\nIn fact, the bug we're fixing in watch mode is so sensitive that we can simply\nrun `git status` to trigger a change to the Git `index.lock`, but this way at\nleast we have a real `*.graphql` file we can touch and watch for avoidance of\nrebuild triggers.\n* fix(watch): Remove double-concatenated `fullPath`, since `path` is already absolute\nParcel Watcher always provides `path` as an absolute path (see the readme for\nthe package), and we were incorrectly concatenating it with absolute path\n`watchDirectory` (and prior to #9270, with `process.cwd()`, which is also an\nabsolute path).\nThis removes the concatenation, which should fix a potential bug when comparing\nto `config.configFilePath`. However, it also means that since #9050, we've been\npassing an absolute path to the `onWatchTriggered` hook, which may or may not\nbe expected by downstream user code. This commit leaves that unchanged, and we\nstill pass it an absolute path.\n* fix(watch): Respect negation and precedence when triggering rebuilds\nImplement the algorithm for deciding when to trigger a rebuild\nduring watch mode, in such a way that precedence (both in terms\nof global config preceding per-target config, and in terms of\nwatch patterns preceding document/schema patterns) is respected,\nand negations are evaluated within their local groups.\nThis algorithm is described and diagrammed here:\nhttps://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/issues/9270#issuecomment-1496765045\n* chore(tests): Return `stopWatching` callback from `createWatcher`\nMake `createWatcher` more testable, by returning a `stopWatching` callback that\ncan be called to stop the otherwise infinitely running watcher. Implement it by\nadding an abort signal handler to the existing process.exit and SIGINT\nhandlers, to call `shutdown()` in the same way.\n* Add mocking infrastructure for `createWatcher` and `@parcel/watcher`\nCreate mocking infrastructure for the watcher, including mocking\n`@parcel/watcher`, so that tests can dispatch file change events\nand spy on the subscription callback.\n* fix(watcher): Improve watcher shutdown precision, add more tests\nThis commit implements graceful shutdown for the watcher, including\nwhen cancelled via an AbortSignal. It also includes a polyfill for\nAbortController, which is necessary on Node v14 (at least without\npassing any experimental flags).\nShutdown events happen in logical order, and as long as the caller\ndoes `await stopRunning()`, it's guaranteed the promise will only\nresolve after the watch server has terminated completely.\n* chore(tests): Add helpers for asserting whether multiple files triggered rebuild\nAdd a helper function that takes a mock watcher, a list of files that\nshould trigger rebuild, and a list of files that should not trigger\nrebuild, and then automatically tests all of them.\nCall the `expect()` functions with an assertion helper that ensures\nthe stack trace shows the relevant functon call, and also adds a\nformatted prelude clearly showing which path was expected to trigger\nor not trigger a rebuild, and what happened instead.\n* fix(watcher): Convert ParcelWatcher ignore paths to be relative to watchDirectory\nParcelWatcher expects the `ParcelWatcher.Options[\\\"ignore\\\"]` array\nto include either absolute paths, or relative paths that are relative\nto the `watchDirectory`. This commit fixes a bug where the paths\nof ignored files (i.e., output directories from stanzas with presetConfig)\nwere relative to `process.cwd()`, which may differ from `watchDirectory`\n* chore(tests): Add assertions for ParcelWatcher.Options.ignore, and refactor\nAdd mocks, assertion helpers, and error formatters for testing\nthe value of paths and globs passed to the `options[\\\"ignore\\\"]`\nargument of `parcelWatcher.subscribe()`.\nNote that we can't properly mock the behavior of this, because\nParcelWatcher implements its ignore logic in C++, so the best we\ncan do is make assertions on the argument it receives.\nThis commit also refactors all of the watch mode testing infrastructure\nto be in a `tests/watch-helpers` directory.\n* chore(tests): Fix some typos, namely preferring \\\"relative from\\\" vs. \\\"relative to\\\"\nThe \\\"relative from\\\" nomenclature matches how NodeJS docs refer to\nthe concept of one path being relative from another, and in the case\nof changes to comments, also matches the actual variable names which\nwere already using `from` instead of `to`\n* fix(watcher): Ignore negated patterns when picking watchDirectory\nWhen picking `watchDirectory` by finding the \\\"longest common prefix directory\\\"\nof all paths and glob patterns, only include affirmative (non-negated)\npatterns. Otherwise, a rule like `!**/never.graphql` will cause\nthe `watchDirectory` to always be `process.cwd()`, because the\nresult of `mm.scan(\\\"!**/never.graphql\\\").base` is `\\\"\\\"`.\n* fix(watcher): Fix logic error in negation precedence, and add more test cases\nRemove `pathMatches` shortcut in favor of explicitly checking for negation\nafter finding an affirmative match, because it turns out this doesn't\nwork. Now the code exactly matches the flow chart.\nThe reason for this change is that micromatch does not give negation\npriority when there is an exact affirmative match, but we expect it to\n(because in our case, negations _always_ take precedence). The micromatch\nbehavior makes sense when you're considering one set of patterns, because\nwhy would you both include and exclude an exact path? But we have the\nadditional complexity of mixing global and local pattern sets, so we can\nnaturally arrive at a situation where a set includes both an exact negated\nmatch, and an exact affirmative match. In this case we still want to negate it.\nWithout this fix, the logic was not working as expected, because a global\nnegation was being ignored when there was a local inclusion.\n* chore(watcher): Add isolated test for each case in addition to combined one\nFor each individual assertion we were making in the big combined config,\nisolate it into a single test that captures the important aspect of it,\nand also add some more specificity to the logic of some of the assertions,\nwhich is much easier to see when isolated within a single test.\nThis should make it easier to identify the source of any future regressions.\nStill, keep the existing test with the big combined config, because it\ncan't hurt. But change \\\"foo\\\" to \\\"fuzz\\\" in that test, just to create\ndifferent strings in case someone wants to grep for a path in a failing\nindividual test.\n* fix(watcher): Import `AbortController` from `@whatwg-node/fetch`\nThere is no need for a poly/pony-fill.\n* Revert \\\"fix(watcher): Import `AbortController` from `@whatwg-node/fetch`\\\"\nThis reverts commit 7a374c27ef7d1f1f02531b7395ff3d37ce12fa31.\nThere is some issue with the implementation of `AbortController`\nin `@whatwg-node/fetch` which causes all the tests to timeout (presumably\nbecause the `AbortSignal` is either not being emitted or received).\")\n\n\n\n | \n\nMay 12, 2023\n\n |\n| \n\n[dev-test](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/tree/master/dev-test

Code Generator is a tool that generates code out of your GraphQL schema. Whether you are developing a frontend or backend, you can utilize GraphQL Code Generator to generate output from your GraphQL Schema and GraphQL Documents (query/mutation/subscription/fragment).\n\nBy analyzing the schema and documents and parsing it, GraphQL Code Generator can output code at a wide variety of formats, based on pre-defined templates or based on custom user-defined ones. Regardless of the language that you're using, GraphQL Code Generator has you covered.\n\nGraphQL Code Generator lets you choose the output that you need, based on _plugins_, which are very flexible and customizable. You can also write your _plugins_ to generate custom outputs that match your needs.\n\nYou can try this tool live on your browser and see some useful examples. Check out [GraphQL Code Generator Live Examples](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/#live-demo).\n\nWe currently support and maintain [these plugins](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins) (TypeScript, Flow, React, Angular, MongoDB, Stencil, Reason, and some more), and there is an active community that writes and maintains custom plugins.\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\n\n[](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator?screenshot=true#quick-start)\n\n> You can find the complete instructions in [GraphQL Code Generator website](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/docs/getting-started/installation).\n\nStart by installing the basic deps of GraphQL Codegen:\n\n```shell\nyarn add graphql\nyarn add -D @graphql-codegen/cli\n```\n\nGraphQL Code Generator lets you setup everything by simply running the following command:\n\n```shell\nyarn graphql-codegen init\n```\n\nQuestion by question, it will guide you through the whole process of setting up a schema, selecting plugins, picking a destination of a generated file, and a lot more.\n\nIf you wish to [manually setup codegen, follow these instructions](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/docs/getting-started/installation).\n\nLinks\n-----\n\n[](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator?screenshot=true#links)\n\nBesides our [docs page](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/docs/getting-started), feel free to go through our published Medium articles to get a better grasp of what GraphQL Code Generator is all about:\n\n*   [All available plugins & presets](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins)\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n[](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator?screenshot=true#contributing)\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to this project, please do read our [Contributor Workflow Guide](https://github.com/the-guild-org/Stack/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before you get started off.\n\nFeel free to open issues and pull requests.
