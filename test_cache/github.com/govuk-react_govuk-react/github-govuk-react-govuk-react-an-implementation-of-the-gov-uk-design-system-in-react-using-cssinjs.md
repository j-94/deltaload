[Remove defaultProps to support React 18.3.0 (](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react/commit/119eb473adcf693fc524dd3a460cdccd0eccf720 "Remove defaultProps to support React 18.3.0 (#1650)
* fix(components): Switch defaultProps to default args
The `defaultProps` has been deprecated for some time for function
components. I have gone through and updated all function components
to use Default Parameters instead. You can see the deprecation notice
at:
https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/createlement-rfc/text/0000-create-element-changes.md#deprecate-defaultprops-on-function-components
* fix(components): Re-add default props
Default props have been removed from functional components, but not
necessarily from styled components. Since the change I made changed
the chromatic tests, I have now reverted this single defaultProp.
* Remove eslint ignore. Use interface instead
* Set the html attribute as search by default
* Remove all defaultProps from components
* Fix back link without href
* Add forwardRef to access inside the wrapper
* Allow Cypress to run on PRs

I've been changing my mind about Prettier for a while now but have it working on govuk-frontend-react in a way that seems to work seamlessly so keen to get it in to govuk-react.
Why:
- I generally like airbnb's rule set
- I see the need to separate stylistic rules from potential issues
- Whereas I'd be happy to have stylistic rules that don't alter the function of code autofix on save, I wouldn't want other rules to autofix on save.
- create-react-app uses prettier, as do a lot of other React devs I know
- I had previously given up on eslint-config-airbnb and prettier working alongside each other as I was encountering conflicting rules, but it turned out this was due to me not including `\"prettier/react\"` in extends")[#629](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react/pull/629)[)](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react/commit/dd2ddbc318933d4bd8757e7f159cfea243f00768 "Feature/prettier post eslint 5 (#629)

[](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react?screenshot=true#using-link-with-a-router-link)

We provide a Link component which creates an element styled as a GDS link. As we are using styled-components it is possible to apply that style to an existing component using the `as` prop. Other props will be passed through.

For example;

```js
import { BrowserRouter, Link as RouterLink } from 'react-router';
import { Link } from '@govuk-react/link';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <nav>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Link as={RouterLink} to="https://example.com">example</Link>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </nav>
);
```

Assumptions
-----------

[](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react?screenshot=true#assumptions)

Use of these components assumes the following from the peer project:

*   The govuk-react `GlobalStyle` component is included on all pages.
*   The GDS Transport font face is included ([for gov.uk domains only](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-your-service-look-like-govuk))
*   Optionally, either [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) or [sanitize.css](https://csstools.github.io/sanitize.css/) is used as a CSS reset. We don't test for this, so please raise an issue if you find any problems with compatibility.
*   Other than the reset, no other styles affecting generic elements (without classes, IDs etc) are present in the CSS.

Why CSS-in-JS?
--------------

[](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react?screenshot=true#why-css-in-js)

See [A Unified Styling Language](https://medium.com/seek-blog/a-unified-styling-language-d0c208de2660).

This project is part of a larger initiative to componetise large scale React applications. Using CSSinJS allows us to include styles inside a module bundle that can be published (using `npm publish`) and consumed by a peer application, without putting dependencies on the peer application to implement a specific CSS build system.

Why not use GDS styles/classes directly
---------------------------------------

[](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react?screenshot=true#why-not-use-gds-stylesclasses-directly)

1.  We want to be free to write different DOM structure and/or CSS that is more in keeping with a React and bem-ish architecture. (e.g. in React you often don't need to specify IDs for field inputs, and can wrap inputs with labels so that they are automatically associated. We want to leave the decision of whether to use input IDs to the parent project. GDS styles don't wrap inputs with labels and require IDs and for attributes).
2.  We want a parent project to not have to worry about a specific build system (e.g. for handling `import styles.css`, particularly if you want universal support) or including certain CSS files. We want a simple `npm install govuk-react` to be enough to get govuk styled components on to your page, irrespective of your build system.
3.  We want to distribute React applications as modules that have self contained styles. CSS in JS allows all styles to be contained in distributable JS modules that can be ported across projects.

Why is this a monorepo?
-----------------------

[](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react?screenshot=true#why-is-this-a-monorepo)

Components are published to npm independently. This means users have the ability to upgrade govuk-react and still use older components.

This is particularly relevant in a large application where:

*   some code is reliant on a component that has either been deprecated or had breaking changes
*   you aren't able to refactor the existing code, e.g. it is a large job or managed by another team
*   you don't want to hold back from upgrading to the newest version of govuk-react

e.g. for DateField, you import it separately as follows:

```js
import { H1, Paragraph } from 'govuk-react';
import DateField from '@govuk-react/date-field';
```

Then in your package.json, you can update govuk-react, but specify the older version of '@govuk-react/date-field'.

About the GDS font
------------------

[](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react?screenshot=true#about-the-gds-font)

Unfortunately the GDS transport font has a relatively restrictive license [described on the gov.uk blog](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/11/can-i-use-the-gov-uk-fonts/). We are investigating rendering an elegant alternative before falling back to Arial on [issue 272](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react/issues/272).

If you would like to contribute, help maintain or sponsor this project, please get in touch via [Discussions](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react/discussions) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/penx).\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n[](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react?screenshot=true#usage)\n\n```shell\nnpm install govuk-react styled-components @types/styled-components --save\n```\n\n```js\nimport { Button } from 'govuk-react'\n\nconst MyComponent = ({title}) => (<div>\n  <h1>{title}</h1>\n  <Button />\n</div>)\n```\n\nSee the [Storybook](https://govuk-react.github.io/govuk-react) for examples of all available components.\n\nAlso see the [Example Application](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react/blob/main/packages/example-application/src) for basic usage.\n\nUsing Link with a Router Link\n-----------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react?screenshot=true#using-link-with-a-router-link)\n\nWe provide a Link component which creates an element styled as a GDS link. As we are using styled-components it is possible to apply that style to an existing component using the `as` prop. Other props will be passed through.\n\nFor example;\n\n```js\nimport { BrowserRouter, Link as RouterLink } from 'react-router';\nimport { Link } from '@govuk-react/link';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => (\n  <nav>\n    <BrowserRouter>\n      <Link as={RouterLink} to=\"https://example.com\">example</Link>\n    </BrowserRouter>\n  </nav>\n);\n```\n\nAssumptions\n-----------\n\n[](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react?screenshot=true#assumptions)\n\nUse of these components assumes the following from the peer project:\n\n*   The govuk-react `GlobalStyle` component is included on all pages.\n*   The GDS Transport font face is included ([for gov.uk domains only](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-your-service-look-like-govuk))\n*   Optionally, either [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) or [sanitize.css](https://csstools.github.io/sanitize.css/) is used as a CSS reset. We don't test for this, so please raise an issue if you find any problems with compatibility.\n*   Other than the reset, no other styles affecting generic elements (without classes, IDs etc) are present in the CSS.\n\nWhy CSS-in-JS?\n--------------\n\n[](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react?screenshot=true#why-css-in-js)\n\nSee [A Unified Styling Language](https://medium.com/seek-blog/a-unified-styling-language-d0c208de2660).\n\nThis project is part of a larger initiative to componetise large scale React applications. Using CSSinJS allows us to include styles inside a module bundle that can be published (using `npm publish`) and consumed by a peer application, without putting dependencies on the peer application to implement a specific CSS build system.\n\nWhy not use GDS styles/classes directly\n---------------------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react?screenshot=true#why-not-use-gds-stylesclasses-directly)\n\n1.  We want to be free to write different DOM structure and/or CSS that is more in keeping with a React and bem-ish architecture. (e.g. in React you often don't need to specify IDs for field inputs, and can wrap inputs with labels so that they are automatically associated. We want to leave the decision of whether to use input IDs to the parent project. GDS styles don't wrap inputs with labels and require IDs and for attributes).\n2.  We want a parent project to not have to worry about a specific build system (e.g. for handling `import styles.css`, particularly if you want universal support) or including certain CSS files. We want a simple `npm install govuk-react` to be enough to get govuk styled components on to your page, irrespective of your build system.\n3.  We want to distribute React applications as modules that have self contained styles. CSS in JS allows all styles to be contained in distributable JS modules that can be ported across projects.\n\nWhy is this a monorepo?\n-----------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react?screenshot=true#why-is-this-a-monorepo)\n\nComponents are published to npm independently. This means users have the ability to upgrade govuk-react and still use older components.\n\nThis is particularly relevant in a large application where:\n\n*   some code is reliant on a component that has either been deprecated or had breaking changes\n*   you aren't able to refactor the existing code, e.g. it is a large job or managed by another team\n*   you don't want to hold back from upgrading to the newest version of govuk-react\n\ne.g. for DateField, you import it separately as follows:\n\n```js\nimport { H1, Paragraph } from 'govuk-react';\nimport DateField from '@govuk-react/date-field';\n```\n\nThen in your package.json, you can update govuk-react, but specify the older version of '@govuk-react/date-field'.\n\nAbout the GDS font\n------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react?screenshot=true#about-the-gds-font)\n\nUnfortunately the GDS transport font has a relatively restrictive license [described on the gov.uk blog](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/11/can-i-use-the-gov-uk-fonts/). We are investigating rendering an elegant alternative before falling back to Arial on [issue 272](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react/issues/272).\n\nRelated sites and projects\n--------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react?screenshot=true#related-sites-and-projects)\n\n### GOV.UK\n\n[](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react?screenshot=true#govuk)\n\n*   [govuk-elements](https://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/) ([source](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/))\n*   [govuk\\_frontend\\_toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit/)\n*   [govuk-frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/)\n*   [govuk\\_template](http://alphagov.github.io/govuk_template/) ([source](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template))\n*   [GOV.UK Design Patterns](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design#find-patterns)\n\n### Other React component libraries\n\n[](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react?screenshot=true#other-react-component-libraries)\n\n*   [Auth0 Cosmos](https://github.com/auth0/cosmos)\n*   [Shopify Polaris](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris)\n*   [Zendesk Garden](https://github.com/zendeskgarden/react-components)\n*   [Atlassian Atlaskit](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2)\n*   [Carbon Design System](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-react)\n*   [Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui)\n*   [Rebass](https://rebassjs.org/)\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\n[](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react?screenshot=true#acknowledgements)\n\nWe use [Chromaticqa](https://www.chromaticqa.com/) for visual regression testing and it is awesome, you should too!\n\n[![Image 34: Deploys by Netlify](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/06244b4a164d9833d1307f2faf193f450c557ac20720531094ab40e9aeb6d32a/68747470733a2f2f7777772e6e65746c6966792e636f6d2f696d672f676c6f62616c2f6261646765732f6e65746c6966792d6c696768742e737667)](https://www.netlify.com/)\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n[](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react?screenshot=true#contributors)\n\n*   [Alasdair McLeay](https://github.com/penx)\n*   [David Murdoch](https://github.com/dsm23)\n*   [Gavin Orland](https://github.com/gavinorland)\n*   [Mark Chambers](https://github.com/marksy)\n*   [Steve Sims](https://github.com/stevesims)\n*   [Taran Chauhan](https://github.com/taranchauhan)\n*   [Toby Brancher](https://github.com/Loque-)\n\nWant to contribute?
