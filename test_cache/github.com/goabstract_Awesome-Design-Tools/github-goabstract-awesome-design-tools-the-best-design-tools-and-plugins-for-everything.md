### Design Feedback Tools

[](https://github.com/goabstract/Awesome-Design-Tools?screenshot=true#design-feedback-tools)

How do you provide and get feedback during the development process? This process is usually pretty messy for many product teams, which caused product delays and time waste on back-and-forth communication. So if you wish to get fast and structural feedback on UI issues or visual bugs — take a look at this tool:

### Design Handoff Tools

[](https://github.com/goabstract/Awesome-Design-Tools?screenshot=true#design-handoff-tools)

Design handoff tools allow to automatically generate style guide, comment on the design, inspect elements. These tools minimize guesswork and improve the effectiveness of the design process.

You can also make a design handoff within Relay, mentioned in the [Design Version Control](https://github.com/goabstract/Awesome-Design-Tools?screenshot=true#design-version-control) section.

### Design Version Control

[](https://github.com/goabstract/Awesome-Design-Tools?screenshot=true#design-version-control)

[![Image 890: Abstract](https://github.com/LisaDziuba/Awesome-Design-Tools/raw/master/Media/Abstract.png)](http://bit.ly/33Q3AC0)

Developers actively use version control tools for a long time, probably since 2005 (Git first release). Using a version control system is no brainer for dev teams, while the design version control system appeared only recently. This market is rapidly developing and we expect to see even more in version control for designers:

### Development Tools

[](https://github.com/goabstract/Awesome-Design-Tools?screenshot=true#development-tools)

This section mentions development tools and browsers. Development browsers have features that help developers and designers create and test websites and apps.

### Experience Monitoring

[](https://github.com/goabstract/Awesome-Design-Tools?screenshot=true#experience-monitoring)

Listening to users is important but seeing the real usage is even more crucial. For these, you need to install different analytic tools, experience monitoring software, and user behavior apps. Just use those analytics solutions concerning users data:

### Font Tools

[](https://github.com/goabstract/Awesome-Design-Tools?screenshot=true#font-tools)

Fonts are commonly used for making the web a more beautiful place. It’s an essential part of any design. In this section, you’ll find fonts generators & font finder tools that allow you to manage and work with fonts:

### Gradient Tools

[](https://github.com/goabstract/Awesome-Design-Tools?screenshot=true#gradient-tools)

You can see gradient colors are everywhere — UI, branding, illustration, typography. A gradient is created by using two or more different colors to paint one element while gradually fading between them. It might look as a memorable, fresh and unique color. To make such a gradient for your design, use these gradient color palettes.

You can also create and audit gradients with Leonardo, which is mentioned in the [Accessibility Tools section](https://github.com/goabstract/Awesome-Design-Tools?screenshot=true#accessibility-tools).
