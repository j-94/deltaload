[\[cli\] update warning in ls --update-required for clarity (](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/commit/40882836d265563a3c894f71bddf75f9d057a6bd "[cli] update warning in ls --update-required for clarity (#12864)
Closes #12856.
The existing logic assumes that if a `discontinueDate` has been set for
a given version of node, that version of node must be deprecated. It was
also easy to mistake the previous code as displaying the warning only
_after_ the discontinue date, which it never did.
This PR:
- Clarifies the language communicating the deprecation to users. It's
not that the node version _will be_ deprecated. The node version is
_already_ deprecated and is at risk of being discontinued.
- Adds an identifier to the logic checking for a deprecated node
version, making it clear that the date check is looking into the future.
- Adds a comment clarifying the logic further, and documents the
assumption that a `discontinueDate` means that a node version is
deprecated.
- Adds a further comment noting that if this assumption is invalid,
additional logic may be required. Specifically, in the case where we
have deprecated a node version, but don't yet know its discontinue date.")[#12864](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/pull/12864)[)](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/commit/40882836d265563a3c894f71bddf75f9d057a6bd "[cli] update warning in ls --update-required for clarity (#12864)

[\[cli\] update warning in ls --update-required for clarity (](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/commit/40882836d265563a3c894f71bddf75f9d057a6bd "[cli] update warning in ls --update-required for clarity (#12864)
Closes #12856.
The existing logic assumes that if a `discontinueDate` has been set for
a given version of node, that version of node must be deprecated. It was
also easy to mistake the previous code as displaying the warning only
_after_ the discontinue date, which it never did.
This PR:
- Clarifies the language communicating the deprecation to users. It's
not that the node version _will be_ deprecated. The node version is
_already_ deprecated and is at risk of being discontinued.
- Adds an identifier to the logic checking for a deprecated node
version, making it clear that the date check is looking into the future.
- Adds a comment clarifying the logic further, and documents the
assumption that a `discontinueDate` means that a node version is
deprecated.
- Adds a further comment noting that if this assumption is invalid,
additional logic may be required. Specifically, in the case where we
have deprecated a node version, but don't yet know its discontinue date.")[#12864](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/pull/12864)[)](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/commit/40882836d265563a3c894f71bddf75f9d057a6bd "[cli] update warning in ls --update-required for clarity (#12864)

[\[remix\] Remove](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/commit/c077e05d5e6591c553e53c047a981e97ecc1c30b "[remix] Remove `@remix-run/dev` dev dependency (#12762)
It was being used for two purposes:
1. Importing types from an internal sub-path
2. Determining the maximum safe version of the forked compiler to use
(only in \"legacy\" Remix mode)
Point 1 is solved by copying the relevent types directly into the Remix
builder package
Point 2 is solved by moving that max version out of `devDependencies`
and into a top-level `package.json` property. The reason for the
placement (i.e. instead of hard-coding the version into the source code)
is so that the value can be easily updated via the update cron job (if
we wanted to go the source code route, we could make the cron job update
the source code via AST transformation at some point in the future, but
this works for now).

[\[tests\] Create tarballs of all packages in Vercel deployment (](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/commit/8167233c56ab3466f66ac47016e68c0eea110530 "[tests] Create tarballs of all packages in Vercel deployment (#7967)
For the Vercel deployment, run `yarn pack` in each of the packages in the monorepo and place them in the \"public/tarballs\" directory so that we can have npm-installable URLs of each package for every commit. The `package.json` of each package is also updated to reference the tarball when a package depends on other packages within the monorepo.
Try it out like:
```
$ npm i -g https://vercel-biww73ffq.vercel.sh/tarballs/vercel.tgz

[Add](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/commit/222710f612800624037fd8bc6abba114403a00b7 "Add `type-check` and unify tsconfig (#10667)
This adds a new `pnpm type-check` that leverages `turbo` to validate the TypeScript code. This can be run at the top-level or for an individual package.
The `test-lint` workflow will run it after linting and doing the prettier check.
As apart of this effort, each package's `tsconfig.json` has been simplified. There's a new top-level `tsconfig.base.json` file that extends the Vercel Style Guide for TypeScript. Each package's `tsconfig.json` has been audited and previously suppressed rules that no longer apply have been removed. The result is each package's `tsconfig.json` is greatly simplified and we can control common settings in the base config while keeping the flexibility of package-level overrides.
Lastly, in `package/cli`, `pnpm build` calls `scripts/build.mjs` which calls `scripts/compile-templates.mjs`. The `compile-templates.mjs` file was generating invalid TypeScript code. I've fixed it and now it's happier than ever.
Note: In order to run `pnpm type-check`, you must first `pnpm build` because we need the `.d.ts` definition files.") ```

[Ensure firewall tests run (](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/commit/cc7b531fcc0ecd0512638fb50375d23e706b9de3 "Ensure firewall tests run (#12551)
Since we run these tests in chunks, we need to use the `vitest-` scripts
so we know to include them in the \"Find changes\" action. From what I can
see we haven't actually been testing this package until now.
Also this package isn't designed to run on Node <20 so updated `engines`

[\[tests\] add vitest custom reporter (](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/commit/195adb472762de69f5250d96e1250c6c20ea7ef6 "[tests] add vitest custom reporter (#11882)
Implemented a basic custom reporter to remove header info from `console.log` lines in `vitest` runs. It copies only the core logic we need from [the base class](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/blob/f1ef2f6362d1607953d383e395d503feb5368613/packages/vitest/src/node/reporters/base.ts#L295).
### Before
In a small example project, I have `console.log` showing order of hooks used. Before this PR, the tests look like this:
```
RUN  v0.33.0 /Users/smassa/source/demo/vitest
stdout | unknown test
~ beforeAll 1
~ beforeAll 2
stdout | sum.test.mjs > other block > nested block > nested: adds 1 + 2
~ beforeEach 1
~ beforeEach 2
~ nested test
stdout | sum.test.mjs > other block > adds 3 + 3
~ beforeEach 1
~ outer test
✓ sum.test.mjs (2)
✓ other block (2)
✓ nested block (1)
✓ nested: adds 1 + 2
✓ adds 3 + 3
Test Files  1 passed (1)
Tests  2 passed (2)
Start at  19:56:58
Duration  217ms (transform 24ms, setup 0ms, collect 12ms, tests 2ms, environment 0ms, prepare 68ms)
```
### After
After this PR, it looks like this:
```
RUN  v2.0.1 /Users/smassa/source/demo/vitest
~ beforeAll 1
~ beforeAll 2
~ beforeEach 1
~ beforeEach 2
~ nested test
~ beforeEach 1
~ outer test
✓ sum.test.mjs (2)
✓ other block (2)
✓ nested block (1)
✓ nested: adds 1 + 2
✓ adds 3 + 3
Test Files  1 passed (1)
Tests  2 passed (2)
Start at  20:24:27
Duration  261ms (transform 13ms, setup 0ms, collect 13ms, tests 2ms, environment 0ms, prepare 62ms)
```
### Why?
The origin header is kinda helpful, when it works. But it (1) doesn't always work and (2) it's pretty verbose.
In cases where we do care a lot about the origin, like the very parallel operations in the Framework Test Matrix, we make sure to log the origin in the message itself. ([example](https://github.com/vercel/api/actions/runs/10015882484/job/27688230963?pr=30087#step:6:572))")[#11882](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/pull/11882)[)](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/commit/195adb472762de69f5250d96e1250c6c20ea7ef6 "[tests] add vitest custom reporter (#11882)

### Vercel

[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#vercel)

Develop. Preview. Ship.

[**Documentation**](https://vercel.com/docs) · [**Changelog**](https://vercel.com/changelog) · [**Templates**](https://vercel.com/templates) · [**CLI**](https://vercel.com/docs/cli)

  

Vercel
------

[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#vercel-1)

Vercel’s Frontend Cloud provides the developer experience and infrastructure to build, scale, and secure a faster, more personalized Web.

Deploy
------

[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#deploy)

Get started by [importing a project](https://vercel.com/new), [choosing a template](https://vercel.com/templates), or using the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli). Then, `git push` to deploy.

Documentation
-------------

[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#documentation)

For details on how to use Vercel, check out our [documentation](https://vercel.com/docs).

Contributing
------------

[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#contributing)

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to install dependencies and run scripts.

You can use the `vercel` script to run local changes as if you were invoking Vercel CLI. For example, `vercel deploy --cwd=/path/to/project` could be run with local changes with `pnpm vercel deploy --cwd=/path/to/project`.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/discussions/new) with the owners of this repository before submitting a Pull Request.

Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and follow it in all your interactions with the project.

### Local development

[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#local-development)

This project is configured in a monorepo, where one repository contains multiple npm packages. Dependencies are installed and managed with `pnpm`, not `npm` CLI.

To get started, execute the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/vercel/vercel
cd vercel
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm lint
pnpm test-unit
```

Make sure all the tests pass before making changes.

#### Running Vercel CLI Changes

[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#running-vercel-cli-changes)

You can use `pnpm vercel` from the `cli` package to invoke Vercel CLI with local changes:

```
cd ./packages/cli
pnpm vercel <cli-commands...>
```

See [CLI Local Development](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/blob/packages/cli#local-development) for more details.

### Verifying your change

[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#verifying-your-change)

Once you are done with your changes (we even suggest doing it along the way), make sure all the tests still pass by running:

```
pnpm test-unit
```

from the root of the project.

If any test fails, make sure to fix it along with your changes. See [Interpreting test errors](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#Interpreting-test-errors) for more information about how the tests are executed, especially the integration tests.

### Pull Request Process

[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#pull-request-process)

Once you are confident that your changes work properly, open a pull request on the main repository.

The pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers and the tests will be checked by our continuous integration platform.

### Interpreting test errors

[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#interpreting-test-errors)

There are 2 kinds of tests in this repository – Unit tests and Integration tests.

Unit tests are run locally with `jest` and execute quickly because they are testing the smallest units of code.

#### Integration tests

[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#integration-tests)

Integration tests create deployments to your Vercel account using the `test` project name. After each test is deployed, the `probes` key is used to check if the response is the expected value. If the value doesn't match, you'll see a message explaining the difference. If the deployment failed to build, you'll see a more generic message like the following:

```
[Error: Fetched page https://test-8ashcdlew.vercel.app/root.js does not contain hello Root!. Instead it contains An error occurred with this application.

    NO_STATUS_CODE_FRO Response headers:
       cache-control=s-maxage=0
      connection=close
      content-type=text/plain; charset=utf-8
      date=Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:01:37 GMT
      server=now
      strict-transport-security=max-age=63072000
      transfer-encoding=chunked
      x-now-id=iad1:hgtzj-1560967297876-44ae12559f95
      x-now-trace=iad1]
```

In such cases, you can visit the URL of the failed deployment and append `/_logs` to see the build error. In the case above, that would be [https://test-8ashcdlew.vercel.app/\_logs](https://test-8ashcdlew.vercel.app/_logs)

The logs of this deployment will contain the actual error which may help you to understand what went wrong.

##### Running integration tests locally

[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#running-integration-tests-locally)

While running the full integration suite locally is not recommended, it's sometimes useful to isolate a failing test by running it on your machine. To do so, you'll need to ensure you have the appropriate credentials sourced in your shell:

1.  Create an access token. Follow the insructions here [https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#creating-an-access-token](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#creating-an-access-token). Ensure the token scope is for your personal account.
2.  Grab the team ID from the Vercel dashboard at `https://vercel.com/<MY-TEAM>/~/settings`.
3.  Source these into your shell rc file: `echo 'export VERCEL_TOKEN=<MY-TOKEN> VERCEL_TEAM_ID=<MY-TEAM-ID>' >> ~/.zshrc`

From there, you should be able to trigger an integration test. Choose one that's already isolated to check that things work:

```
cd packages/next
```

Run the test:

```
pnpm test test/fixtures/00-server-build/index.test.js
```

#### @vercel/nft

[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#vercelnft)

Some of the Builders use `@vercel/nft` to tree-shake files before deployment. If you suspect an error with this tree-shaking mechanism, you can create the following script in your project:

```js
const { nodeFileTrace } = require('@vercel/nft');
nodeFileTrace(['path/to/entrypoint.js'], {
  ts: true,
  mixedModules: true,
})
  .then(o => console.log(o.fileList))
  .then(e => console.error(e));
```

When you run this script, you'll see all the imported files. If files are missing, the bug is in [@vercel/nft](https://github.com/vercel/nft) and not the Builder.

### Deploy a Builder with existing project

[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#deploy-a-builder-with-existing-project)

Sometimes you want to test changes to a Builder against an existing project, maybe with `vercel dev` or actual deployment. You can avoid publishing every Builder change to npm by uploading the Builder as a tarball.

1.  Change directory to the desired Builder `cd ./packages/node`
2.  Run `pnpm build` to compile typescript and other build steps
3.  Run `npm pack` to create a tarball file
4.  Run `vercel *.tgz` to upload the tarball file and get a URL
5.  Edit any existing `vercel.json` project and replace `use` with the URL
6.  Run `vercel` or `vercel dev` to deploy with the experimental Builder

The reason for the\nplacement (i.e. instead of hard-coding the version into the source code)\nis so that the value can be easily updated via the update cron job (if\nwe wanted to go the source code route, we could make the cron job update\nthe source code via AST transformation at some point in the future, but\nthis works for now).\n---------\nCo-authored-by: Trek Glowacki <trek.glowacki@vercel.com>\")\n\n\n\n | \n\nDec 17, 2024\n\n |\n| \n\n[.editorconfig](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/blob/main/.editorconfig \".editorconfig\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n | \n\n[.editorconfig](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/blob/main/.editorconfig \".editorconfig\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n | \n\n[Revert \"Revert \"\\[go\\] Implement](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/commit/ced949514365adfe86d621de1b1d52b41fbe53f4 \"Revert \\\"Revert \\\"[go] Implement `startDevServer()` function (#4662)\\\" (#4899)\\\" (#4906)\nThis reverts commit 8d1afc026ff0f9e7f299e46c172ad2c4e05978b5.\") ```\n[startDevServer()](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/commit/ced949514365adfe86d621de1b1d52b41fbe53f4 \"Revert \\\"Revert \\\"[go] Implement `startDevServer()` function (#4662)\\\" (#4899)\\\" (#4906)\nThis reverts commit 8d1afc026ff0f9e7f299e46c172ad2c4e05978b5.\")\n``` [function (](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/commit/ced949514365adfe86d621de1b1d52b41fbe53f4 \"Revert \\\"Revert \\\"[go] Implement `startDevServer()` function (#4662)\\\" (#4899)\\\" (#4906)\nThis reverts commit 8d1afc026ff0f9e7f299e46c172ad2c4e05978b5.\")[#4662](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/pull/4662)[)\" (](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/commit/ced949514365adfe86d621de1b1d52b41fbe53f4 \"Revert \\\"Revert \\\"[go] Implement `startDevServer()` function (#4662)\\\" (#4899)\\\" (#4906)\nThis reverts commit 8d1afc026ff0f9e7f299e46c172ad2c4e05978b5.\")[#…](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/pull/4899)\n\n\n\n | \n\nJul 22, 2020\n\n |\n| \n\n[.eslintignore](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/blob/main/.eslintignore \".eslintignore\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n | \n\n[.eslintignore](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/blob/main/.eslintignore \".eslintignore\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n | \n\n[\\[sdk\\] move sdk (](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/commit/fa5a6ad45bb85c4c3a501459c6f55a6fd135f021 \"[sdk] move sdk (#12700)\nThe `sdk` package has moved to: https://github.com/vercel/sdk\n---------\nCo-authored-by: Trek Glowacki <trek.glowacki@vercel.com>\")[#12700](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/pull/12700)[)](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/commit/fa5a6ad45bb85c4c3a501459c6f55a6fd135f021 \"[sdk] move sdk (#12700)\nThe `sdk` package has moved to: https://github.com/vercel/sdk\n---------\nCo-authored-by: Trek Glowacki <trek.glowacki@vercel.com>\")\n\n\n\n | \n\nDec 9, 2024\n\n |\n| \n\n[.gitattributes](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/blob/main/.gitattributes \".gitattributes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n | \n\n[.gitattributes](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/blob/main/.gitattributes \".gitattributes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n | \n\n[\\[cli\\] Add git metadata to](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/commit/1f0ca46626b497ee3d8e9a33bb8d665d345c0ef3 \"[cli] Add git metadata to `vc deploy` (#7910)\nCurrently, git metadata is not included on the Vercel dashboard when a project is deployed via the CLI.

Preview. Ship.\n\n[**Documentation**](https://vercel.com/docs) · [**Changelog**](https://vercel.com/changelog) · [**Templates**](https://vercel.com/templates) · [**CLI**](https://vercel.com/docs/cli)\n\n  \n\nVercel\n------\n\n[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#vercel-1)\n\nVercel’s Frontend Cloud provides the developer experience and infrastructure to build, scale, and secure a faster, more personalized Web.\n\nDeploy\n------\n\n[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#deploy)\n\nGet started by [importing a project](https://vercel.com/new), [choosing a template](https://vercel.com/templates), or using the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli). Then, `git push` to deploy.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#documentation)\n\nFor details on how to use Vercel, check out our [documentation](https://vercel.com/docs).\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#contributing)\n\nThis project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to install dependencies and run scripts.\n\nYou can use the `vercel` script to run local changes as if you were invoking Vercel CLI. For example, `vercel deploy --cwd=/path/to/project` could be run with local changes with `pnpm vercel deploy --cwd=/path/to/project`.\n\nWhen contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/discussions/new) with the owners of this repository before submitting a Pull Request.\n\nPlease read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and follow it in all your interactions with the project.\n\n### Local development\n\n[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#local-development)\n\nThis project is configured in a monorepo, where one repository contains multiple npm packages. Dependencies are installed and managed with `pnpm`, not `npm` CLI.\n\nTo get started, execute the following:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/vercel/vercel\ncd vercel\ncorepack enable\npnpm install\npnpm build\npnpm lint\npnpm test-unit\n```\n\nMake sure all the tests pass before making changes.\n\n#### Running Vercel CLI Changes\n\n[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#running-vercel-cli-changes)\n\nYou can use `pnpm vercel` from the `cli` package to invoke Vercel CLI with local changes:\n\n```\ncd ./packages/cli\npnpm vercel <cli-commands...>\n```\n\nSee [CLI Local Development](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/blob/packages/cli#local-development) for more details.\n\n### Verifying your change\n\n[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#verifying-your-change)\n\nOnce you are done with your changes (we even suggest doing it along the way), make sure all the tests still pass by running:\n\n```\npnpm test-unit\n```\n\nfrom the root of the project.\n\nIf any test fails, make sure to fix it along with your changes. See [Interpreting test errors](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#Interpreting-test-errors) for more information about how the tests are executed, especially the integration tests.\n\n### Pull Request Process\n\n[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#pull-request-process)\n\nOnce you are confident that your changes work properly, open a pull request on the main repository.\n\nThe pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers and the tests will be checked by our continuous integration platform.\n\n### Interpreting test errors\n\n[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#interpreting-test-errors)\n\nThere are 2 kinds of tests in this repository – Unit tests and Integration tests.\n\nUnit tests are run locally with `jest` and execute quickly because they are testing the smallest units of code.\n\n#### Integration tests\n\n[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#integration-tests)\n\nIntegration tests create deployments to your Vercel account using the `test` project name. After each test is deployed, the `probes` key is used to check if the response is the expected value. If the value doesn't match, you'll see a message explaining the difference. If the deployment failed to build, you'll see a more generic message like the following:\n\n```\n[Error: Fetched page https://test-8ashcdlew.vercel.app/root.js does not contain hello Root!. Instead it contains An error occurred with this application.\n\n    NO_STATUS_CODE_FRO Response headers:\n       cache-control=s-maxage=0\n      connection=close\n      content-type=text/plain; charset=utf-8\n      date=Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:01:37 GMT\n      server=now\n      strict-transport-security=max-age=63072000\n      transfer-encoding=chunked\n      x-now-id=iad1:hgtzj-1560967297876-44ae12559f95\n      x-now-trace=iad1]\n```\n\nIn such cases, you can visit the URL of the failed deployment and append `/_logs` to see the build error. In the case above, that would be [https://test-8ashcdlew.vercel.app/\\_logs](https://test-8ashcdlew.vercel.app/_logs)\n\nThe logs of this deployment will contain the actual error which may help you to understand what went wrong.\n\n##### Running integration tests locally\n\n[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#running-integration-tests-locally)\n\nWhile running the full integration suite locally is not recommended, it's sometimes useful to isolate a failing test by running it on your machine. To do so, you'll need to ensure you have the appropriate credentials sourced in your shell:\n\n1.  Create an access token. Follow the insructions here [https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#creating-an-access-token](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#creating-an-access-token). Ensure the token scope is for your personal account.\n2.  Grab the team ID from the Vercel dashboard at `https://vercel.com/<MY-TEAM>/~/settings`.\n3.  Source these into your shell rc file: `echo 'export VERCEL_TOKEN=<MY-TOKEN> VERCEL_TEAM_ID=<MY-TEAM-ID>' >> ~/.zshrc`\n\nFrom there, you should be able to trigger an integration test. Choose one that's already isolated to check that things work:\n\n```\ncd packages/next\n```\n\nRun the test:\n\n```\npnpm test test/fixtures/00-server-build/index.test.js\n```\n\n#### @vercel/nft\n\n[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#vercelnft)\n\nSome of the Builders use `@vercel/nft` to tree-shake files before deployment. If you suspect an error with this tree-shaking mechanism, you can create the following script in your project:\n\n```js\nconst { nodeFileTrace } = require('@vercel/nft');\nnodeFileTrace(['path/to/entrypoint.js'], {\n  ts: true,\n  mixedModules: true,\n})\n  .then(o => console.log(o.fileList))\n  .then(e => console.error(e));\n```\n\nWhen you run this script, you'll see all the imported files. If files are missing, the bug is in [@vercel/nft](https://github.com/vercel/nft) and not the Builder.\n\n### Deploy a Builder with existing project\n\n[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#deploy-a-builder-with-existing-project)\n\nSometimes you want to test changes to a Builder against an existing project, maybe with `vercel dev` or actual deployment. You can avoid publishing every Builder change to npm by uploading the Builder as a tarball.\n\n1.  Change directory to the desired Builder `cd ./packages/node`\n2.  Run `pnpm build` to compile typescript and other build steps\n3.  Run `npm pack` to create a tarball file\n4.  Run `vercel *.tgz` to upload the tarball file and get a URL\n5.  Edit any existing `vercel.json` project and replace `use` with the URL\n6.  Run `vercel` or `vercel dev` to deploy with the experimental Builder\n\nReference\n---------\n\n[](https://github.com/vercel/vercel?screenshot=true#reference)\n\n*   [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n*   [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n*   [Apache 2.0 License](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/blob/main/LICENSE)\n\nAbout\n-----\n\nDevelop.
