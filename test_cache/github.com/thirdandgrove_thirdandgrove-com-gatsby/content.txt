Deployment
----------

[](https://github.com/thirdandgrove/thirdandgrove-com-gatsby?screenshot=true#deployment)

This website is built with NodeJS. It uses the React-based open source framework [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). This framework generates a static site.

This website uses [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment. Netlify's platform performs automated builds of the static site. It also links to GIT workflow. When a pull request is created it triggers an automated build of the static site that is pinned to the code in that Pull Request.

To deploy code to [https://www.thirdandgrove.com/](https://www.thirdandgrove.com/) a content editor has to either trigger a build after a content change or a developer has to push code to the master branch (whether that is a direct commit to master or merging a pull request).

Currently build times range from 45 min to 1 hr.

1.  Create a pull request with the new code
2.  Get verification that change is correct from the preview url
3.  Merging code into master will trigger a production build
