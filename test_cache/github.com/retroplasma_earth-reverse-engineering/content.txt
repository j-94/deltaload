*   [README](https://github.com/retroplasma/earth-reverse-engineering?screenshot=true#)

[![Image 10: header](https://github.com/retroplasma/earth-reverse-engineering/raw/master/header.png)](https://github.com/retroplasma/earth-reverse-engineering/blob/master/header.png)

Reverse-engineering undocumented parts of Google Earth. Similar work is done for Apple Maps [here](https://github.com/retroplasma/flyover-reverse-engineering).

#### Status

[](https://github.com/retroplasma/earth-reverse-engineering?screenshot=true#status)

The focus has been on the 3D satellite mode, which required digging into:

*   URL structures
*   octrees and conversion from geo coordinates
*   Protobuf formats of assets and metadata
*   postprocessing steps (e.g. unpacking of meshes and textures)

Code was written and tested with various regions and cities:

*   [Flycam client](https://github.com/retroplasma/earth-reverse-engineering/blob/master/client) (C++, native + WebAssembly)
*   [Model exporter](https://github.com/retroplasma/earth-reverse-engineering/blob/master/exporter) (JS, works without photogrammetry or graphics debuggers)

#### Info

[](https://github.com/retroplasma/earth-reverse-engineering?screenshot=true#info)

URL structure:

```
"https://kh.google.com/rt/🅐/🅑"
 - 🅐: planet
       - "earth"
       - "mars"
       - ...
 - 🅑: resource
       - "PlanetoidMetadata"
       - "BulkMetadata/pb=!1m2!1s❶!2u❷"
          - ❶: octant path
          - ❷: epoch
       - "NodeData/pb=!1m2!1s❸!2u❹!2e❺(!3u❻)!4b0"
          - ❸: octant path
          - ❹: epoch
          - ❺: texture format
          - ❻: imagery epoch (sometimes)
```

Misc:

```
General info:
 - Everything is stored in an octree.

Roles of resources:
 - PlanetoidMetadata points to first BulkMetaData.
 - BulkMetaData points to other BulkMetaData and to NodeData.
 - NodeData contains actual meshes and textures.

Versioning:
 - BulkMetaData and NodeData are versioned using epoch numbers.
 - PlanetoidMetadata provides epoch of first BulkMetaData.
 - BulkMetaData provides epochs of underlying resources.
 - Current version of a resource can be determined recursively.

NodeData:
 - Mesh: packed XYZ, UV, octant mask, normals
 - Texture: JPG, CRN-DXT1
 - Raw format: see rocktree.proto and rocktree_decoder.h
 - Other optimizations: BVH
BulkMetaData:
 - Oriented Bounding Box
    - Dump OBB to obj: https://gist.github.com/retroplasma/5698808bfaa63ffd03f751a84fa6ce14
    - Latlong to octant using OBB (unstable): https://github.com/retroplasma/earth-reverse-engineering/blob/443a3622ce9cb12cd4460cc6dc7999cc703ae67f/experimental_latlong_to_octant.js
