introduction
------------

[](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx?screenshot=true#introduction)

htmx allows you to access [AJAX](https://htmx.org/docs#ajax), [CSS Transitions](https://htmx.org/docs#css_transitions), [WebSockets](https://htmx.org/docs#websockets) and [Server Sent Events](https://htmx.org/docs#sse) directly in HTML, using [attributes](https://htmx.org/reference#attributes), so you can build [modern user interfaces](https://htmx.org/examples) with the [simplicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) and [power](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) of hypertext

htmx is small ([~14k min.gz'd](https://unpkg.com/htmx.org/dist/)), [dependency-free](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/blob/master/package.json) & [extendable](https://htmx.org/extensions)

motivation
----------

[](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx?screenshot=true#motivation)

*   Why should only `<a>` and `<form>` be able to make HTTP requests?
*   Why should only `click` & `submit` events trigger them?
*   Why should only GET & POST be available?
*   Why should you only be able to replace the _entire_ screen?

By removing these arbitrary constraints htmx completes HTML as a [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext)

quick start
-----------

[](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx?screenshot=true#quick-start)

```html
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@2.0.4"></script>
  <!-- have a button POST a click via AJAX -->
  <button hx-post="/clicked" hx-swap="outerHTML">
    Click Me
  </button>
```

The [`hx-post`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-post) and [`hx-swap`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap) attributes tell htmx:

> "When a user clicks on this button, issue an AJAX request to /clicked, and replace the entire button with the response"

htmx is the successor to [intercooler.js](http://intercoolerjs.org/)

### installing as a node package

[](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx?screenshot=true#installing-as-a-node-package)

To install using npm:

```
npm install htmx.org --save
```

Note there is an old broken package called `htmx`. This is `htmx.org`.

### hacking guide

[](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx?screenshot=true#hacking-guide)

To develop htmx locally, you will need to install the development dependencies.

Run:

```
npm install
```

Then, run a web server in the root.

This is easiest with:

```
npx serve
```

You can then run the test suite by navigating to:

[http://0.0.0.0:3000/test/](http://0.0.0.0:3000/test/)

At this point you can modify `/src/htmx.js` to add features, and then add tests in the appropriate area under `/test`.

*   `/test/index.html` - the root test page from which all other tests are included
*   `/test/attributes` - attribute specific tests
*   `/test/core` - core functionality tests
*   `/test/core/regressions.js` - regression tests
*   `/test/ext` - extension tests
*   `/test/manual` - manual tests that cannot be automated

htmx uses the [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework, the [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) assertion framework and [sinon](https://sinonjs.org/releases/v9/fake-xhr-and-server/) to mock out AJAX requests. They are all OK.

You can also run live tests and demo of the WebSockets and Server-Side Events extensions with `npm run ws-tests`

allows you to access [AJAX](https://htmx.org/docs#ajax), [CSS Transitions](https://htmx.org/docs#css_transitions), [WebSockets](https://htmx.org/docs#websockets) and [Server Sent Events](https://htmx.org/docs#sse) directly in HTML, using [attributes](https://htmx.org/reference#attributes), so you can build [modern user interfaces](https://htmx.org/examples) with the [simplicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) and [power](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) of hypertext\n\nhtmx is small ([~14k min.gz'd](https://unpkg.com/htmx.org/dist/)), [dependency-free](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/blob/master/package.json) & [extendable](https://htmx.org/extensions)\n\nmotivation\n----------\n\n[](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx?screenshot=true#motivation)\n\n*   Why should only `<a>` and `<form>` be able to make HTTP requests?\n*   Why should only `click` & `submit` events trigger them?\n*   Why should only GET & POST be available?\n*   Why should you only be able to replace the _entire_ screen?\n\nBy removing these arbitrary constraints htmx completes HTML as a [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext)\n\nquick start\n-----------\n\n[](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx?screenshot=true#quick-start)\n\n```html\n  <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@2.0.4\"></script>\n  <!-- have a button POST a click via AJAX -->\n  <button hx-post=\"/clicked\" hx-swap=\"outerHTML\">\n    Click Me\n  </button>\n```\n\nThe [`hx-post`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-post) and [`hx-swap`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap) attributes tell htmx:\n\n> \"When a user clicks on this button, issue an AJAX request to /clicked, and replace the entire button with the response\"\n\nhtmx is the successor to [intercooler.js](http://intercoolerjs.org/)\n\n### installing as a node package\n\n[](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx?screenshot=true#installing-as-a-node-package)\n\nTo install using npm:\n\n```\nnpm install htmx.org --save\n```\n\nNote there is an old broken package called `htmx`. This is `htmx.org`.\n\nwebsite & docs\n--------------\n\n[](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx?screenshot=true#website--docs)\n\n*   [https://htmx.org](https://htmx.org/)\n*   [https://htmx.org/docs](https://htmx.org/docs)\n\ncontributing\n------------\n\n[](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx?screenshot=true#contributing)\n\nWant to contribute? Check out our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nNo time? Then [become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/bigskysoftware#sponsors)\n\n### hacking guide\n\n[](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx?screenshot=true#hacking-guide)\n\nTo develop htmx locally, you will need to install the development dependencies.\n\nRun:\n\n```\nnpm install\n```\n\nThen, run a web server in the root.\n\nThis is easiest with:\n\n```\nnpx serve\n```\n\nYou can then run the test suite by navigating to:\n\n[http://0.0.0.0:3000/test/](http://0.0.0.0:3000/test/)\n\nAt this point you can modify `/src/htmx.js` to add features, and then add tests in the appropriate area under `/test`.\n\n*   `/test/index.html` - the root test page from which all other tests are included\n*   `/test/attributes` - attribute specific tests\n*   `/test/core` - core functionality tests\n*   `/test/core/regressions.js` - regression tests\n*   `/test/ext` - extension tests\n*   `/test/manual` - manual tests that cannot be automated\n\nhtmx uses the [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework, the [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) assertion framework and [sinon](https://sinonjs.org/releases/v9/fake-xhr-and-server/) to mock out AJAX requests. They are all OK.\n\nYou can also run live tests and demo of the WebSockets and Server-Side Events extensions with `npm run ws-tests`\n\nhaiku\n-----\n\n[](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx?screenshot=true#haiku)\n\n_javascript fatigue:  \nlonging for a hypertext  \nalready in hand_\n\nAbout\n-----\n\n</\\> htmx - high power tools for HTML\n\n[htmx.org](https://htmx.org/ \"https://htmx.org\")\n\n### Topics\n\n[javascript](https://github.com/topics/javascript \"Topic: javascript\") [html](https://github.com/topics/html \"Topic: html\") [rest](https://github.com/topics/rest \"Topic: rest\") [hyperscript](https://github.com/topics/hyperscript \"Topic: hyperscript\") [hateoas](https://github.com/topics/hateoas \"Topic: hateoas\") [htmx](https://github.com/topics/htmx \"Topic: htmx\")\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx?screenshot=true#readme-ov-file)\n\n### License\n\n[View license](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx?screenshot=true#License-1-ov-file)\n\n[Activity](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/activity)\n\n[Custom properties](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/custom-properties)\n\n### Stars\n\n[**43.1k** stars](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/stargazers)\n\n### Watchers\n\n[**218** watching](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/watchers)\n\n### Forks\n\n[**1.4k** forks](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/forks)\n\n[Report repository](https://github.com/contact/report-content?content_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbigskysoftware%2Fhtmx&report=bigskysoftware+%28user%29)\n\n[Releases 24](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/releases)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[v2.0.4 Latest Dec 13, 2024](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/releases/tag/v2.0.4)\n\n[\\+ 23 releases](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/releases)\n\nSponsor this project\n--------------------\n\n[Packages 0](https://github.com/orgs/bigskysoftware/packages?repo_name=htmx)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo packages published  \n\n[Contributors 399](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/graphs/contributors)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   [![Image 34: @1cg](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/469183?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/1cg)\n*   [![Image 35: @bencroker](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57572400?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/bencroker)\n*   [![Image 36: @benpate](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4381040?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/benpate)\n*   [![Image 37: @alexpetros](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23287457?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/alexpetros)\n*   [![Image 38: @Telroshan](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19146183?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/Telroshan)\n*   [![Image 39: @dependabot[bot]](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/apps/dependabot)\n*   [![Image 40: @Renerick](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20725046?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/Renerick)\n*   [![Image 41: @dz4k](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39595683?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/dz4k)\n*   [![Image 42: @guettli](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/414336?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/guettli)\n*   [![Image 43: @adamchainz](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857609?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/adamchainz)\n*   [![Image 44: @danieljsummers](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/880348?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/danieljsummers)\n*   [![Image 45: @MichaelWest22](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12867972?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/MichaelWest22)\n*   [![Image 46: @jreviews](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31069418?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/jreviews)\n*   [![Image 47: @jvosloo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180948?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/jvosloo)\n\n[\\+ 385 contributors](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/graphs/contributors)\n\nLanguages\n---------\n\n*   [JavaScript 91.4%](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/search?l=javascript)\n*   [HTML 7.7%](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/search?l=html)\n*   Other 0.9%\n\nFooter\n------\n\n[](https://github.com/ \"GitHub\")© 2025 GitHub, Inc.\n\n### Footer navigation\n\n*   [Terms](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service)\n*   [Privacy](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)\n*   [Security](https://github.com/security)\n*   [Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/)\n*   [Docs](https://docs.github.com/)\n*   [Contact](https://support.github.com/?tags=dotcom-footer)\n*   Manage cookies\n*   Do not share my personal information\n\nYou can’t perform that action at this time.",
