Motivation 🤔
-------------

[](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd?screenshot=true#motivation-)

`react-beautiful-dnd` exists to create beautiful drag and drop for lists that anyone can use - even people who cannot see. For a good overview of the history and motivations of the project you can take a look at these external resources:

*   📖 [Rethinking drag and drop](https://medium.com/@alexandereardon/rethinking-drag-and-drop-d9f5770b4e6b)
*   🎧 [React podcast: fast, accessible and beautiful drag and drop](https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm/17)

Not for everyone ✌️
-------------------

[](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd?screenshot=true#not-for-everyone-%EF%B8%8F)

There are a lot of libraries out there that allow for drag and drop interactions within React. Most notable of these is the amazing [`react-dnd`](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd). It does an incredible job at providing a great set of drag and drop primitives which work especially well with the [wildly inconsistent](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/09/the_html5_drag.html) html5 drag and drop feature. `react-beautiful-dnd` is a higher level abstraction specifically built for lists (vertical, horizontal, movement between lists, nested lists and so on). Within that subset of functionality `react-beautiful-dnd` offers a powerful, natural and beautiful drag and drop experience. However, it does not provide the breadth of functionality offered by `react-dnd`. So `react-beautiful-dnd` might not be for you depending on what your use case is.
