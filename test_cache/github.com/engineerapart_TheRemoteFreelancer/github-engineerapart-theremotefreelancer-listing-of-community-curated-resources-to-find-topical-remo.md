Why
---

[](https://github.com/engineerapart/TheRemoteFreelancer?screenshot=true#why)

This repo was inspired by [this Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12773282) about one software developer's experience with Upwork. For all those who have had bad experiences with Upwork, I wanted to create a list of additional resources that software developers can use to find freelance, nomadic and contract work.

Contributing
------------

[](https://github.com/engineerapart/TheRemoteFreelancer?screenshot=true#contributing)

Please please please contribute to the list! If you have freelance work available or know someone who does, feel free to open a pull request to augment this list!

Thank you for looking :) Good hunting!

Differences between types
-------------------------

[](https://github.com/engineerapart/TheRemoteFreelancer?screenshot=true#differences-between-types)

|  | Clients | Jobs | Agency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Interaction with Clients | Your interaction is with clients directly, organization does little/no communication with clients | You interact with employers directly, organization does little/no communication with clients | Organization handles clients and just gives you work. You have little/no interaction with clients |
| Control over working environment | Generally you can work however, using own tools, supplies, set own hours, etc | Employer controls how you work generally. Provides tools, sets hours, tasks, etc. | Agency might direct you on what tasks to do but you have flexibility on how to accomplish them |
| Payment | Client pays you, but through the organization (which may takes its cut) | Employer pays you salary (withholding taxes) | Agency pays you |
| Choice of Client or Project | Complete control of client/project | Complete control of job selection | Little/no choice of project or client |
| Vetting/Interviews | Clients vets you | Companies vet you | Organization vets you, Client wouldn't really vet you individual |
