Resources to help independent developers make money.

Making money from your own code has never been easier, but it's still hard. Here, I try to curate a list of resources to help everyone interested in making money from their digital products get inspired and give it a try. Be it monetizing side-projects, bootstrapping business ideas, etc.

Projects don't need to be big, actually, it's better if they are not, they just need to be profitable. They might provide a passive income after the initial bulk of work, and who knows, maybe even help you reach financial independence.

Going indie does have lots of lifestyle perks :)

All these resources might help inspire you and put you on the right track but in the end what matters is to **MAKE and TRY stuff**. So devour this content responsibly :)

Contributions are more than welcome.

*   If \[$\], it means it's not free and probably means I haven't tried it but still decided to add it because of the several references.
*   This repo was once [#1 on Github Trending](https://medium.com/@mezood/making-money-from-your-own-code-has-never-been-easier-but-its-still-hard-2242ddaae6a1)! :\_)

*   **[IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses)**
    
    Learn from profitable businesses and side projects. IndieHackers is probably the catalyst for this new wave of interest on making an independent income. It is a collection of interviews to successful developers about their products. IndieHackers has been especially interesting to follow since it's been an indie project itself. [Courtland Allen](https://twitter.com/csallen?lang=ca) has been very transparent about [how he built it](https://www.indiehackers.com/blog). The last news make one think that the forum/community will grow.

    The challenge that started it all for Pieter. It inspired me to do something similar. What matters is to create and ship a lot, learning in the process, until something is worth pushing further.
    
*   **[Don't Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/)** by [Patrick McKenzie](https://twitter.com/patio11?lang=ca)
    
    Patrick has written over 500 posts and I have obviously not read all of them, but of the many I've read, I chose this one...

    This is just an example of a business more than one would be happy with :-) Besides liking how Tyler shares his story building Storemapper, I think he always maximizes for valuable content.
    
*   **[Why You Should Do A Tiny Product First](https://unicornfree.com/2013/why-you-should-do-a-tiny-product-first)** by [Amy Hoy](https://twitter.com/amyhoy)
    
    This is the first of a series by Amy Hoy. I'll be honest, I don't even remember what this was about, just that I found it worth my time. Oh wait, yeah, Amy told me not to code, at least at first. I haven't still gotten there...

### Courses

[](https://github.com/mezod/awesome-indie?screenshot=true#courses)

Again, I'm not quite fond of listing \[$\] products made by indie developers targeting indie developers, especially because I haven't tried them myself, but due to several references I assume they are probably worth it and some people might find value in learning about them.

*   **[Marketing for Developers](https://devmarketing.xyz/)** \[$\]

Here, I try to curate a list of resources to help everyone interested in making money from their digital products get inspired and give it a try. Be it monetizing side-projects, bootstrapping business ideas, etc.\n\nProjects don't need to be big, actually, it's better if they are not, they just need to be profitable. They might provide a passive income after the initial bulk of work, and who knows, maybe even help you reach financial independence.\n\nGoing indie does have lots of lifestyle perks :)\n\nAll these resources might help inspire you and put you on the right track but in the end what matters is to **MAKE and TRY stuff**.
