Digital land data collector
===========================

[](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector?screenshot=true#digital-land-data-collector)

Configuration and tools to collect geographical data published by government which may be useful for people building houses.

[![Image 8: digital-land](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/bc89a62735734e32ce074e5bce3b4be0ed69aa1486882bed43e83ce466c9f39a/68747470733a2f2f6661726d322e737461746963666c69636b722e636f6d2f313734342f34323632323335323038315f373065393061343632325f622e6a7067)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/42622352081/ "digital-land")

1.  Data is collected from the sources in the [publication](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/publication) configuration into the `var/cache` directory.
2.  Cached data is transformed into [geojson](http://geojson.org/) containing [WGS84](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/exchange-of-location-point) coordinates in the `var/geojson` directory.
3.  Features are extracted into a simplified geojson format in the `data/features` directory.
4.  Properties are mapped into a consistent, register-like data model, in the `data/entry` directory.

The collected features and properties are periodically published in the following repositories:

*   [digital-land-data](https://github.com/communitiesuk/digital-land-data)
*   [landregistry-index-data](https://github.com/communitiesuk/landregistry-index-data)

Which can be explored using the [digital-land-explorer](https://github.com/communitiesuk/digital-land-explorer) application.

Configuration
=============

[](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector?screenshot=true#configuration)

*   [data/publication](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/publication) — source publications
*   [data/licence](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/licence) — licence terms and conditions
*   [data/copyright](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/copyright) — copyright, attribution terms and conditions
*   [data/organisation](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/organisation.tsv) — publishing organisations

The [etc](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/etc) directory contains prototype register data where no [GOV.UK register](https://www.registers.service.gov.uk/) exists yet.

Adding a publication
====================

[](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector?screenshot=true#adding-a-publication)

To add a publication, add a markdown file in the [publication](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/publication) directory with the following front matter fields:

| Field | Value | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `publication` | A unique, symbolic name created for each publication | `national-park-boundaries` |
| `name` | A descriptive name for the publication | `National Park Boundary` |
| `organisation` | [organisation](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/organisation.tsv) reference | `government-organisation:D303` |
| `copyright` | [copyright](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/copyright) reference | `ons-boundary` |
| `licence` | [licence](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/licence) reference | `ogl` |
| `data-gov-uk` | [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/) reference | `671bdd94-f9e8-41fd-997c-c371fca050de` |
| `documentation-url` | Link to documentation | `http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/national-parks-august-2016-full-extent-boundaries-in-great-britain` |
| `data-url` | Link to data | `http://geoportal1-ons.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/df607d4ffa124cdca8317e3e63d45d78_1.geojson` |
| `task` | The collection [task](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/task) | `geojson` |
| `prefix` | A unique, symbolic name for the scope of identifiers | `national-park-boundary` |
| `key` | The property name to be taken as the identifier | `npark16cd` |

The markdown can contain information about the publication.

Add the path to your markdown file to the [publication index](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/publication/index.tsv) and rebuild the makefiles (below).

Collecting data
===============

[](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector?screenshot=true#collecting-data)

We recommend working in [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) before installing the python dependencies:

```
$ make init
```

Transforming shapefiles depends upon the [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) [ogr2ogr](http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html) command.

Adding a file changes the dependencies. Ensure the new file path is in the [index.tsv](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/publication/index.tsv) file and rebuild the makefiles:

```
$ make makefiles
```

The datasets are collected using download and conversion scripts in the [bin](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/bin) and [lib](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/lib) directories:

```
$ make
```
