Digital land data collector
===========================

[](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector?screenshot=true#digital-land-data-collector)

Configuration and tools to collect geographical data published by government which may be useful for people building houses.

[![Image 8: digital-land](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/bc89a62735734e32ce074e5bce3b4be0ed69aa1486882bed43e83ce466c9f39a/68747470733a2f2f6661726d322e737461746963666c69636b722e636f6d2f313734342f34323632323335323038315f373065393061343632325f622e6a7067)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/42622352081/ "digital-land")

1.  Data is collected from the sources in the [publication](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/publication) configuration into the `var/cache` directory.
2.  Cached data is transformed into [geojson](http://geojson.org/) containing [WGS84](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/exchange-of-location-point) coordinates in the `var/geojson` directory.
3.  Features are extracted into a simplified geojson format in the `data/features` directory.
4.  Properties are mapped into a consistent, register-like data model, in the `data/entry` directory.

The collected features and properties are periodically published in the following repositories:

*   [digital-land-data](https://github.com/communitiesuk/digital-land-data)
*   [landregistry-index-data](https://github.com/communitiesuk/landregistry-index-data)

Which can be explored using the [digital-land-explorer](https://github.com/communitiesuk/digital-land-explorer) application.

Configuration
=============

[](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector?screenshot=true#configuration)

*   [data/publication](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/publication) â source publications
*   [data/licence](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/licence) â licence terms and conditions
*   [data/copyright](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/copyright) â copyright, attribution terms and conditions
*   [data/organisation](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/organisation.tsv) â publishing organisations

The [etc](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/etc) directory contains prototype register data where no [GOV.UK register](https://www.registers.service.gov.uk/) exists yet.

Adding a publication
====================

[](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector?screenshot=true#adding-a-publication)

To add a publication, add a markdown file in the [publication](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/publication) directory with the following front matter fields:

| Field | Value | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `publication` | A unique, symbolic name created for each publication | `national-park-boundaries` |
| `name` | A descriptive name for the publication | `National Park Boundary` |
| `organisation` | [organisation](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/organisation.tsv) reference | `government-organisation:D303` |
| `copyright` | [copyright](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/copyright) reference | `ons-boundary` |
| `licence` | [licence](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/licence) reference | `ogl` |
| `data-gov-uk` | [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/) reference | `671bdd94-f9e8-41fd-997c-c371fca050de` |
| `documentation-url` | Link to documentation | `http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/national-parks-august-2016-full-extent-boundaries-in-great-britain` |
| `data-url` | Link to data | `http://geoportal1-ons.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/df607d4ffa124cdca8317e3e63d45d78_1.geojson` |
| `task` | The collection [task](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/task) | `geojson` |
| `prefix` | A unique, symbolic name for the scope of identifiers | `national-park-boundary` |
| `key` | The property name to be taken as the identifier | `npark16cd` |

The markdown can contain information about the publication.

Add the path to your markdown file to the [publication index](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/publication/index.tsv) and rebuild the makefiles (below).

Collecting data
===============

[](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector?screenshot=true#collecting-data)

We recommend working in [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) before installing the python dependencies:

```
$ make init
```

Transforming shapefiles depends upon the [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) [ogr2ogr](http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html) command.

Adding a file changes the dependencies. Ensure the new file path is in the [index.tsv](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/publication/index.tsv) file and rebuild the makefiles:

```
$ make makefiles
```

The datasets are collected using download and conversion scripts in the [bin](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/bin) and [lib](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/lib) directories:

```
$ make
```

Data is collected from the sources in the [publication](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/publication) configuration into the `var/cache` directory.\n2.  Cached data is transformed into [geojson](http://geojson.org/) containing [WGS84](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/exchange-of-location-point) coordinates in the `var/geojson` directory.\n3.  Features are extracted into a simplified geojson format in the `data/features` directory.\n4.  Properties are mapped into a consistent, register-like data model, in the `data/entry` directory.\n\nThe collected features and properties are periodically published in the following repositories:\n\n*   [digital-land-data](https://github.com/communitiesuk/digital-land-data)\n*   [landregistry-index-data](https://github.com/communitiesuk/landregistry-index-data)\n\nWhich can be explored using the [digital-land-explorer](https://github.com/communitiesuk/digital-land-explorer) application.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\n[](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector?screenshot=true#configuration)\n\n*   [data/publication](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/publication) â source publications\n*   [data/licence](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/licence) â licence terms and conditions\n*   [data/copyright](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/copyright) â copyright, attribution terms and conditions\n*   [data/organisation](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/organisation.tsv) â publishing organisations\n\nThe [etc](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/etc) directory contains prototype register data where no [GOV.UK register](https://www.registers.service.gov.uk/) exists yet.\n\nAdding a publication\n====================\n\n[](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector?screenshot=true#adding-a-publication)\n\nTo add a publication, add a markdown file in the [publication](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/publication) directory with the following front matter fields:\n\n| Field | Value | Example |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| `publication` | A unique, symbolic name created for each publication | `national-park-boundaries` |\n| `name` | A descriptive name for the publication | `National Park Boundary` |\n| `organisation` | [organisation](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/organisation.tsv) reference | `government-organisation:D303` |\n| `copyright` | [copyright](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/copyright) reference | `ons-boundary` |\n| `licence` | [licence](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/licence) reference | `ogl` |\n| `data-gov-uk` | [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/) reference | `671bdd94-f9e8-41fd-997c-c371fca050de` |\n| `documentation-url` | Link to documentation | `http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/national-parks-august-2016-full-extent-boundaries-in-great-britain` |\n| `data-url` | Link to data | `http://geoportal1-ons.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/df607d4ffa124cdca8317e3e63d45d78_1.geojson` |\n| `task` | The collection [task](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/task) | `geojson` |\n| `prefix` | A unique, symbolic name for the scope of identifiers | `national-park-boundary` |\n| `key` | The property name to be taken as the identifier | `npark16cd` |\n\nThe markdown can contain information about the publication.\n\nAdd the path to your markdown file to the [publication index](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/publication/index.tsv) and rebuild the makefiles (below).\n\nCollecting data\n===============\n\n[](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector?screenshot=true#collecting-data)\n\nWe recommend working in [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) before installing the python dependencies:\n\n```\n$ make init\n```\n\nTransforming shapefiles depends upon the [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) [ogr2ogr](http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html) command.\n\nAdding a file changes the dependencies. Ensure the new file path is in the [index.tsv](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/data/publication/index.tsv) file and rebuild the makefiles:\n\n```\n$ make makefiles\n```\n\nThe datasets are collected using download and conversion scripts in the [bin](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/bin) and [lib](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/blob/master/lib) directories:\n\n```\n$ make\n```\n\nLicence\n=======\n\n[](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector?screenshot=true#licence)\n\nThe software in this project is open source and covered by LICENSE file.\n\nIndividual datasets copied into this repository may have specific copyright and licensing, otherwise all content and data in this repository is [Â© Crown copyright](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/copyright-and-re-use/crown-copyright/) and available under the terms of the [Open Government 3.0](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) licence.\n\nAbout\n-----\n\nTools for collecting geographical and other data published by government which may be useful for people building houses.\n\n### Topics\n\n[digital-land](https://github.com/topics/digital-land \"Topic: digital-land\")\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector?screenshot=true#readme-ov-file)\n\n### License\n\n[MIT license](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector?screenshot=true#MIT-1-ov-file)\n\n[Activity](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/activity)\n\n[Custom properties](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/custom-properties)\n\n### Stars\n\n[**5** stars](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/stargazers)\n\n### Watchers\n\n[**7** watching](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/watchers)\n\n### Forks\n\n[**2** forks](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/forks)\n\n[Report repository](https://github.com/contact/report-content?content_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdigital-land-attic%2Fdigital-land-collector&report=digital-land-attic+%28user%29)\n\n[Releases](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/releases)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo releases published\n\n[Packages 0](https://github.com/orgs/digital-land-attic/packages?repo_name=digital-land-collector)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo packages published  \n\n[Contributors 3](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/graphs/contributors)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*    [![Image 9: @psd](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5833?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/psd)[**psd** Paul Downey](https://github.com/psd)\n*    [![Image 10: @ashimali](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/666250?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/ashimali)[**ashimali** Adam Shimali](https://github.com/ashimali)\n*    [![Image 11: @colmjude](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/299875?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/colmjude)[**colmjude** Colm Britton](https://github.com/colmjude)\n\nLanguages\n---------\n\n*   [Python 85.3%](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/search?l=python)\n*   [Makefile 13.9%](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/search?l=makefile)\n*   [Shell 0.8%](https://github.com/digital-land-attic/digital-land-collector/search?l=shell)\n\nFooter\n------\n\n[](https://github.com/ \"GitHub\")Â© 2025 GitHub,Â Inc.\n\n### Footer navigation\n\n*   [Terms](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service)\n*   [Privacy](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)\n*   [Security](https://github.com/security)\n*   [Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/)\n*   [Docs](https://docs.github.com/)\n*   [Contact](https://support.github.com/?tags=dotcom-footer)\n*   Manage cookies\n*   Do not share my personal information\n\nYou canât perform that action at this time.",
