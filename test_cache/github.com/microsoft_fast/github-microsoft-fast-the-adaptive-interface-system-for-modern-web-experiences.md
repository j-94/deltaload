# Pull Request
## üìñ Description
This change updates documentation and pipelines to reference `main` as default branch name instead of `master`.

This change also updates broken links in the versioned docs to point to the archived branch. The builds may not kick off properly for this PR however since these are only pipeline and documentation updates I expect nothing should break and future PRs will not be affected.

[Replace lerna and yarn with npm workspaces (](https://github.com/microsoft/fast/commit/78910b1158a6a24b717b3d94616fa93ab6786ab4 "Replace lerna and yarn with npm workspaces (#7000)
# Pull Request
## üìñ Description
This change replaces `yarn` and `lerna` with `npm` workspaces. This should help a lot with dependency management as we were on yarn 1 which had a fairly heavily manipulated dependency tree.
The changes also upgrade most dependencies to their latest versions and the changes may reflect this, such as updating all versions of webpack to webpack 5.

## üìñ Description
<!---
Provide some background and a description of your work.
What problem does this change solve?
Is this a breaking change, chore, fix, feature, etc?
-->
This branch adds the following:
- A FAST Style element that will hydrate styles client side
- A webpack config that will build the minimal JS for the logic for this web component so that the file `fast-style.min.js` can be referred to in server side generated HTML
### üé´ Issues
<!---

Closes #5575
## üë©‚Äçüíª Reviewer Notes
<!---
Provide some notes for reviewers to help them provide targeted feedback and testing.
Do you recommend a smoke test for this PR? What steps should be followed?
Are there particular areas of the code the reviewer should focus on?
-->
If you run the test server after building all the necessary files, you can navigate to `localhost:8080/fast-style` and see the component working there. One thing is the fixture uses `shadowroot=\"open\"` to be able to see which styles are applied to nested elements during Playwright testing. This does not need the case for actual implementation, the shadowroot can be closed, this has been manually verified.
## üìë Test Plan
<!---
Please provide a summary of the tests affected by this work and any unique strategies employed in testing the features/fixes.
-->
The added tests are Playwright tests, I'll let reviewers comment as to whether more tests are needed, this however tests the base case of applying styles to the container of the fast-style web component.

This change will pin the `checkchange` check in the github workflow to check for changes against the `features/fast-element-2` branch. Since the branch should only be checking PRs against its contents and not the default branch this is the current workaround for checking for changefiles against non-default branches. This change must be removed prior to inclusion to the default branch.

When running `npm run build` inside `@microsoft/fast-element` package, the following error is encountered:
`Error: Error parsing tsconfig.json content: Unknown compiler option 'importsNotUsedAsValues'.`
This happens because running `api-extractor` happens as a final step in the `build`, and the reason this error occurs is that the currently pinned version `typescript` used by `api-extractor` is below `3.8.0` when `importsNotUsedAsValues` was introduced as a flag. This change updates the version, we now have no errors, but the following warnings with this change:
```

* Added specification for a FAST CLI and project initialization package (#5669)
# Pull Request
## üìñ Description
<!---
Provide some background and a description of your work.
What problem does this change solve?
Is this a breaking change, chore, fix, feature, etc?
-->
This specification is based on the need for FAST to have a CLI for accelerating workflows and provide an easy way to initialize a project. 
### üé´ Issues
<!---
* List and link relevant issues here.
-->
Related to https://github.com/microsoft/fast/issues/5578
## üë©‚Äçüíª Reviewer Notes
<!---
Provide some notes for reviewers to help them provide targeted feedback and testing.
Do you recommend a smoke test for this PR? What steps should be followed?
Are there particular areas of the code the reviewer should focus on?
-->
I believe some work has been done on this already but the priorities have shifted around, this is my interpretation for what the requirements are and what generally the goals should be. Please give this a thorough read and determine if this captures all requirements, an MVP roadmap is included at the bottom. This is targeting the feature branch including FAST element 2.0 and the server side rendering work as I believe these are related.

# Pull Request
## üìñ Description
<!---
Provide some background and a description of your work.
What problem does this change solve?
Is this a breaking change, chore, fix, feature, etc?
-->
This branch adds the following:
- A FAST Style element that will hydrate styles client side
- A webpack config that will build the minimal JS for the logic for this web component so that the file `fast-style.min.js` can be referred to in server side generated HTML
### üé´ Issues

Closes #5575
## üë©‚Äçüíª Reviewer Notes
<!---
Provide some notes for reviewers to help them provide targeted feedback and testing.
Do you recommend a smoke test for this PR? What steps should be followed?
Are there particular areas of the code the reviewer should focus on?
-->
If you run the test server after building all the necessary files, you can navigate to `localhost:8080/fast-style` and see the component working there. One thing is the fixture uses `shadowroot=\"open\"` to be able to see which styles are applied to nested elements during Playwright testing. This does not need the case for actual implementation, the shadowroot can be closed, this has been manually verified.
## üìë Test Plan
<!---
Please provide a summary of the tests affected by this work and any unique strategies employed in testing the features/fixes.
-->
The added tests are Playwright tests, I'll let reviewers comment as to whether more tests are needed, this however tests the base case of applying styles to the container of the fast-style web component.

This change will pin the `checkchange` check in the github workflow to check for changes against the `features/fast-element-2` branch. Since the branch should only be checking PRs against its contents and not the default branch this is the current workaround for checking for changefiles against non-default branches. This change must be removed prior to inclusion to the default branch.

When running `npm run build` inside `@microsoft/fast-element` package, the following error is encountered:
`Error: Error parsing tsconfig.json content: Unknown compiler option 'importsNotUsedAsValues'.`
This happens because running `api-extractor` happens as a final step in the `build`, and the reason this error occurs is that the currently pinned version `typescript` used by `api-extractor` is below `3.8.0` when `importsNotUsedAsValues` was introduced as a flag. This change updates the version, we now have no errors, but the following warnings with this change:
```

I believe some work has been done on this already but the priorities have shifted around, this is my interpretation for what the requirements are and what generally the goals should be. Please give this a thorough read and determine if this captures all requirements, an MVP roadmap is included at the bottom. This is targeting the feature branch including FAST element 2.0 and the server side rendering work as I believe these are related.

[Remove eslint config package (](https://github.com/microsoft/fast/commit/00bccd7812ca072fc2efdf39af7762bbfdc90846 "Remove eslint config package (#6970)
# Pull Request
## üìñ Description
Removal of the `@microsoft/eslint-config-fast-dna` package as we reserve the right to change eslint configurations and will not be maintaining a package outside this repository. As such, the configuration options have been moved to the root `.eslintrc`.
### üé´ Issues
Resolves #6948
## üë©‚Äçüíª Reviewer Notes
The logic has not changed here, we are only moving this package configuration options internal, and I have added \"prettier\" as an extension as all current packages re-extend it anyway.

[Replace lerna and yarn with npm workspaces (](https://github.com/microsoft/fast/commit/78910b1158a6a24b717b3d94616fa93ab6786ab4 "Replace lerna and yarn with npm workspaces (#7000)
# Pull Request
## üìñ Description
This change replaces `yarn` and `lerna` with `npm` workspaces. This should help a lot with dependency management as we were on yarn 1 which had a fairly heavily manipulated dependency tree.
The changes also upgrade most dependencies to their latest versions and the changes may reflect this, such as updating all versions of webpack to webpack 5.

[Replace lerna and yarn with npm workspaces (](https://github.com/microsoft/fast/commit/78910b1158a6a24b717b3d94616fa93ab6786ab4 "Replace lerna and yarn with npm workspaces (#7000)
# Pull Request
## üìñ Description
This change replaces `yarn` and `lerna` with `npm` workspaces. This should help a lot with dependency management as we were on yarn 1 which had a fairly heavily manipulated dependency tree.
The changes also upgrade most dependencies to their latest versions and the changes may reflect this, such as updating all versions of webpack to webpack 5.

accelerating workflows and provide an easy way to initialize a project. \n### üé´ Issues\n<!---\n* List and link relevant issues here.\n-->\nRelated to https://github.com/microsoft/fast/issues/5578\n## üë©‚Äçüíª Reviewer Notes\n<!---\nProvide some notes for reviewers to help them provide targeted feedback and testing.\nDo you recommend a smoke test for this PR? What steps should be followed?\nAre there particular areas of the code the reviewer should focus on?\n-->\nI believe some work has been done on this already but the priorities have shifted around, this is my interpretation for what the requirements are and what generally the goals should be. Please give this a thorough read and determine if this captures all requirements, an MVP roadmap is included at the bottom. This is targeting the feature branch including FAST element 2.0 and the server side rendering work as I believe these are related.\n## ‚úÖ Checklist\n### General\n<!--- Review the list and put an x in

etc?\n-->\nThis branch adds the following:\n- A FAST Style element that will hydrate styles client side\n- A webpack config that will build the minimal JS for the logic for this web component so that the file `fast-style.min.js` can be referred to in server side generated HTML\n### üé´ Issues\n<!---\n* List and link relevant issues here.\n-->\nCloses #5575\n## üë©‚Äçüíª Reviewer

One thing is the fixture uses `shadowroot=\\\"open\\\"` to be able to see which styles are applied to nested elements during Playwright testing. This does not need the case for actual implementation, the shadowroot can be closed, this has been manually verified.\n## üìë Test Plan\n<!---\nPlease provide a summary of the tests affected by this work and any unique strategies employed in testing the features/fixes.\n-->\nThe added tests are Playwright tests, I'll let reviewers comment as to whether more tests are needed, this however tests the base case of applying styles to the container of the fast-style web component.\n## ‚úÖ Checklist\n### General\n<!--- Review the list and put an x in the boxes that apply. -->\n- [ ] I have included a change request file using `$ yarn change`\n- [x] I have added tests for my changes.\n- [x] I have tested my changes.\n- [ ] I have updated the project documentation to reflect my changes.\n- [ ] I have read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/Microsoft/fast/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) documentation and followed the [standards](https://www.fast.design/docs/community/code-of-conduct/#our-standards) for this project.\n## ‚è≠ Next Steps\n<!---\nIf there is relevant follow-up work to this PR, please list any existing issues or provide brief descriptions of what you would like to do next.\n-->\n- Integrate the FASTStyle wc to the HTML renderer #5576\n* Pin the checkchange to the feature branch (#5611)\n# Pull Request\n## üìñ Description\n<!---\nProvide some background and a description of your work.\nWhat problem does this change solve?\nIs this a breaking change, chore, fix, feature, etc?\n-->\nThis change will pin the `checkchange` check in the github workflow to check for changes against the `features/fast-element-2` branch.
