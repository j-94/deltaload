[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#plans)

New features under development(order by estimated release time). Your feedbacks about the features are very important.

Framework of Qlib
-----------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#framework-of-qlib)

[![Image 73](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/raw/main/docs/_static/img/framework-abstract.jpg)](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/docs/_static/img/framework-abstract.jpg)

The high-level framework of Qlib can be found above(users can find the [detailed framework](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/introduction.html#framework) of Qlib's design when getting into nitty gritty). The components are designed as loose-coupled modules, and each component could be used stand-alone.

Qlib provides a strong infrastructure to support Quant research. [Data](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/data.html) is always an important part. A strong learning framework is designed to support diverse learning paradigms (e.g. [reinforcement learning](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/rl.html), [supervised learning](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/workflow.html#model-section)) and patterns at different levels(e.g. [market dynamic modeling](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/meta.html)). By modeling the market, [trading strategies](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/strategy.html) will generate trade decisions that will be executed. Multiple trading strategies and executors in different levels or granularities can be [nested to be optimized and run together](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/highfreq.html). At last, a comprehensive [analysis](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/report.html) will be provided and the model can be [served online](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/online.html) in a low cost.

Quick Start
-----------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#quick-start)

This quick start guide tries to demonstrate

1.  It's very easy to build a complete Quant research workflow and try your ideas with _Qlib_.
2.  Though with _public data_ and _simple models_, machine learning technologies **work very well** in practical Quant investment.

Here is a quick **[demo](https://terminalizer.com/view/3f24561a4470)** shows how to install `Qlib`, and run LightGBM with `qrun`. **But**, please make sure you have already prepared the data following the [instruction](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#data-preparation).

Installation
------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#installation)

This table demonstrates the supported Python version of `Qlib`:

|  | install with pip | install from source | plot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Python 3.8 | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Python 3.9 | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Python 3.10 | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Python 3.11 | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Python 3.12 | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |

**Note**:

1.  **Conda** is suggested for managing your Python environment. In some cases, using Python outside of a `conda` environment may result in missing header files, causing the installation failure of certain packages.
2.  Please pay attention that installing cython in Python 3.6 will raise some error when installing `Qlib` from source. If users use Python 3.6 on their machines, it is recommended to _upgrade_ Python to version 3.8 or higher, or use `conda`'s Python to install `Qlib` from source.

### Install with pip

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#install-with-pip)

Users can easily install `Qlib` by pip according to the following command.

**Note**: pip will install the latest stable qlib. However, the main branch of qlib is in active development. If you want to test the latest scripts or functions in the main branch. Please install qlib with the methods below.

### Install from source

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#install-from-source)

Also, users can install the latest dev version `Qlib` by the source code according to the following steps:

*   Before installing `Qlib` from source, users need to install some dependencies:
    
    pip install numpy
    pip install --upgrade cython
    
*   Clone the repository and install `Qlib` as follows.
    
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/qlib.git && cd qlib
    pip install .  # \`pip install -e .\[dev\]\` is recommended for development. check details in docs/developer/code\_standard\_and\_dev\_guide.rst
    

**Tips**: If you fail to install `Qlib` or run the examples in your environment, comparing your steps and the [CI workflow](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/.github/workflows/test_qlib_from_source.yml) may help you find the problem.

**Tips for Mac**: If you are using Mac with M1, you might encounter issues in building the wheel for LightGBM, which is due to missing dependencies from OpenMP. To solve the problem, install openmp first with `brew install libomp` and then run `pip install .` to build it successfully.

Data Preparation
----------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#data-preparation)

❗ Due to more restrict data security policy. The offical dataset is disabled temporarily. You can try [this data source](https://github.com/chenditc/investment_data/releases) contributed by the community. Here is an example to download the latest data.

wget https://github.com/chenditc/investment\_data/releases/latest/download/qlib\_bin.tar.gz
mkdir -p ~/.qlib/qlib\_data/cn\_data
tar -zxvf qlib\_bin.tar.gz -C ~/.qlib/qlib\_data/cn\_data --strip-components=2
rm -f qlib\_bin.tar.gz

The official dataset below will resume in short future.

* * *

Load and prepare data by running the following code:

### Get with module

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#get-with-module)

# get 1d data
python -m qlib.run.get\_data qlib\_data --target\_dir ~/.qlib/qlib\_data/cn\_data --region cn

# get 1min data
python -m qlib.run.get\_data qlib\_data --target\_dir ~/.qlib/qlib\_data/cn\_data\_1min --region cn --interval 1min

### Get from source

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#get-from-source)

# get 1d data
python scripts/get\_data.py qlib\_data --target\_dir ~/.qlib/qlib\_data/cn\_data --region cn

# get 1min data
python scripts/get\_data.py qlib\_data --target\_dir ~/.qlib/qlib\_data/cn\_data\_1min --region cn --interval 1min

This dataset is created by public data collected by [crawler scripts](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/scripts/data_collector), which have been released in the same repository. Users could create the same dataset with it. [Description of dataset](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/tree/main/scripts/data_collector#description-of-dataset)

_Please pay **ATTENTION** that the data is collected from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/lookup), and the data might not be perfect. We recommend users to prepare their own data if they have a high-quality dataset. For more information, users can refer to the [related document](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/data.html#converting-csv-format-into-qlib-format)_.

### Automatic update of daily frequency data (from yahoo finance)

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#automatic-update-of-daily-frequency-data-from-yahoo-finance)

> This step is _Optional_ if users only want to try their models and strategies on history data.
> 
> It is recommended that users update the data manually once (--trading\_date 2021-05-25) and then set it to update automatically.
> 
> **NOTE**: Users can't incrementally update data based on the offline data provided by Qlib(some fields are removed to reduce the data size). Users should use [yahoo collector](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/tree/main/scripts/data_collector/yahoo#automatic-update-of-daily-frequency-datafrom-yahoo-finance) to download Yahoo data from scratch and then incrementally update it.
> 
> For more information, please refer to: [yahoo collector](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/tree/main/scripts/data_collector/yahoo#automatic-update-of-daily-frequency-datafrom-yahoo-finance)

*   Automatic update of data to the "qlib" directory each trading day(Linux)
    
    *   use _crontab_: `crontab -e`
        
    *   set up timed tasks:
        
        ```
        * * * * 1-5 python <script path> update_data_to_bin --qlib_data_1d_dir <user data dir>
        ```
        
        *   **script path**: _scripts/data\_collector/yahoo/collector.py_
*   Manual update of data
    
    ```
    python scripts/data_collector/yahoo/collector.py update_data_to_bin --qlib_data_1d_dir <user data dir> --trading_date <start date> --end_date <end date>
    ```
    
    *   _trading\_date_: start of trading day
    *   _end\_date_: end of trading day(not included)

### Checking the health of the data

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#checking-the-health-of-the-data)

*   We provide a script to check the health of the data, you can run the following commands to check whether the data is healthy or not.
    
    ```
    python scripts/check_data_health.py check_data --qlib_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data
    ```
    
*   Of course, you can also add some parameters to adjust the test results, such as this.
    
    ```
    python scripts/check_data_health.py check_data --qlib_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --missing_data_num 30055 --large_step_threshold_volume 94485 --large_step_threshold_price 20

Auto Quant Research Workflow
----------------------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#auto-quant-research-workflow)

Qlib provides a tool named `qrun` to run the whole workflow automatically (including building dataset, training models, backtest and evaluation). You can start an auto quant research workflow and have a graphical reports analysis according to the following steps:

1.  Quant Research Workflow: Run `qrun` with lightgbm workflow config ([workflow\_config\_lightgbm\_Alpha158.yaml](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/benchmarks/LightGBM/workflow_config_lightgbm_Alpha158.yaml) as following.
    
      cd examples  # Avoid running program under the directory contains \`qlib\`
      qrun benchmarks/LightGBM/workflow\_config\_lightgbm\_Alpha158.yaml
    
    If users want to use `qrun` under debug mode, please use the following command:
    
    python -m pdb qlib/workflow/cli.py examples/benchmarks/LightGBM/workflow\_config\_lightgbm\_Alpha158.yaml
    
    The result of `qrun` is as follows, please refer to [Intraday Trading](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/backtest.html) for more details about the result.
    
    'The following are analysis results of the excess return without cost.'

Building Customized Quant Research Workflow by Code
---------------------------------------------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#building-customized-quant-research-workflow-by-code)

The automatic workflow may not suit the research workflow of all Quant researchers. To support a flexible Quant research workflow, Qlib also provides a modularized interface to allow researchers to build their own workflow by code. [Here](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/workflow_by_code.ipynb) is a demo for customized Quant research workflow by code.

Main Challenges & Solutions in Quant Research
---------------------------------------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#main-challenges--solutions-in-quant-research)

Quant investment is a very unique scenario with lots of key challenges to be solved. Currently, Qlib provides some solutions for several of them.

Forecasting: Finding Valuable Signals/Patterns
----------------------------------------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#forecasting-finding-valuable-signalspatterns)

Accurate forecasting of the stock price trend is a very important part to construct profitable portfolios. However, huge amount of data with various formats in the financial market which make it challenging to build forecasting models.

An increasing number of SOTA Quant research works/papers, which focus on building forecasting models to mine valuable signals/patterns in complex financial data, are released in `Qlib`

Your PR of new Quant models is highly welcomed.

The performance of each model on the `Alpha158` and `Alpha360` datasets can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/benchmarks/README.md).

### Run a single model

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#run-a-single-model)

All the models listed above are runnable with `Qlib`. Users can find the config files we provide and some details about the model through the [benchmarks](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/benchmarks) folder. More information can be retrieved at the model files listed above.

`Qlib` provides three different ways to run a single model, users can pick the one that fits their cases best:

*   Users can use the tool `qrun` mentioned above to run a model's workflow based from a config file.
    
*   Users can create a `workflow_by_code` python script based on the [one](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/workflow_by_code.py) listed in the `examples` folder.
    
*   Users can use the script [`run_all_model.py`](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/run_all_model.py) listed in the `examples` folder to run a model. Here is an example of the specific shell command to be used: `python run_all_model.py run --models=lightgbm`, where the `--models` arguments can take any number of models listed above(the available models can be found in [benchmarks](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/benchmarks)). For more use cases, please refer to the file's [docstrings](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/run_all_model.py).
    
    *   **NOTE**: Each baseline has different environment dependencies, please make sure that your python version aligns with the requirements(e.g. TFT only supports Python 3.6~3.7 due to the limitation of `tensorflow==1.15.0`)

### Run multiple models

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#run-multiple-models)

`Qlib` also provides a script [`run_all_model.py`](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/run_all_model.py) which can run multiple models for several iterations. (**Note**: the script only support _Linux_ for now. Other OS will be supported in the future. Besides, it doesn't support parallel running the same model for multiple times as well, and this will be fixed in the future development too.)

The script will create a unique virtual environment for each model, and delete the environments after training. Thus, only experiment results such as `IC` and `backtest` results will be generated and stored.

Here is an example of running all the models for 10 iterations:

python run\_all\_model.py run 10

It also provides the API to run specific models at once. For more use cases, please refer to the file's [docstrings](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/run_all_model.py).

[Adapting to Market Dynamics](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/benchmarks_dynamic)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#adapting-to-market-dynamics)

Due to the non-stationary nature of the environment of the financial market, the data distribution may change in different periods, which makes the performance of models build on training data decays in the future test data. So adapting the forecasting models/strategies to market dynamics is very important to the model/strategies' performance.

Here is a list of solutions built on `Qlib`.

*   [Rolling Retraining](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/benchmarks_dynamic/baseline)
*   [DDG-DA on pytorch (Wendi, et al. AAAI 2022)](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/benchmarks_dynamic/DDG-DA)

Reinforcement Learning: modeling continuous decisions
-----------------------------------------------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#reinforcement-learning-modeling-continuous-decisions)

Qlib now supports reinforcement learning, a feature designed to model continuous investment decisions. This functionality assists investors in optimizing their trading strategies by learning from interactions with the environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.

Here is a list of solutions built on `Qlib` categorized by scenarios.

### [RL for order execution](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/rl_order_execution)

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#rl-for-order-execution)

[Here](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/rl/overall.html#order-execution) is the introduction of this scenario. All the methods below are compared [here](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/rl_order_execution).

*   [OPDS: "Universal Trading for Order Execution with Oracle Policy Distillation", AAAI 2021](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/rl_order_execution/exp_configs/backtest_opds.yml)

Quant Dataset Zoo
-----------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#quant-dataset-zoo)

Dataset plays a very important role in Quant. Here is a list of the datasets built on `Qlib`:

| Dataset | US Market | China Market |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Alpha360](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/qlib/contrib/data/handler.py) | √ | √ |
| [Alpha158](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/qlib/contrib/data/handler.py) | √ | √ |

[Here](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/alpha.html) is a tutorial to build dataset with `Qlib`. Your PR to build new Quant dataset is highly welcomed.

Learning Framework
------------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#learning-framework)

Qlib is high customizable and a lot of its components are learnable. The learnable components are instances of `Forecast Model` and `Trading Agent`. They are learned based on the `Learning Framework` layer and then applied to multiple scenarios in `Workflow` layer. The learning framework leverages the `Workflow` layer as well(e.g. sharing `Information Extractor`, creating environments based on `Execution Env`).

Based on learning paradigms, they can be categorized into reinforcement learning and supervised learning.

*   For supervised learning, the detailed docs can be found [here](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/model.html).
*   For reinforcement learning, the detailed docs can be found [here](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/rl.html). Qlib's RL learning framework leverages `Execution Env` in `Workflow` layer to create environments. It's worth noting that `NestedExecutor` is supported as well. This empowers users to optimize different level of strategies/models/agents together (e.g. optimizing an order execution strategy for a specific portfolio management strategy).

More About Qlib
---------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#more-about-qlib)

If you want to have a quick glance at the most frequently used components of qlib, you can try notebooks [here](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/tutorial).

The detailed documents are organized in [docs](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/docs). [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/) and the readthedocs theme is required to build the documentation in html formats.

cd docs/
conda install sphinx sphinx\_rtd\_theme -y
# Otherwise, you can install them with pip
# pip install sphinx sphinx\_rtd\_theme
make html

You can also view the [latest document](http://qlib.readthedocs.io/) online directly.

Qlib is in active and continuing development. Our plan is in the roadmap, which is managed as a [github project](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/projects/1).

Offline Mode and Online Mode
----------------------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#offline-mode-and-online-mode)

The data server of Qlib can either deployed as `Offline` mode or `Online` mode. The default mode is offline mode.

Under `Offline` mode, the data will be deployed locally.

Under `Online` mode, the data will be deployed as a shared data service. The data and their cache will be shared by all the clients. The data retrieval performance is expected to be improved due to a higher rate of cache hits. It will consume less disk space, too. The documents of the online mode can be found in [Qlib-Server](https://qlib-server.readthedocs.io/). The online mode can be deployed automatically with [Azure CLI based scripts](https://qlib-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html#one-click-deployment-in-azure). The source code of online data server can be found in [Qlib-Server repository](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib-server).

Performance of Qlib Data Server
-------------------------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#performance-of-qlib-data-server)

The performance of data processing is important to data-driven methods like AI technologies. As an AI-oriented platform, Qlib provides a solution for data storage and data processing. To demonstrate the performance of Qlib data server, we compare it with several other data storage solutions.

We evaluate the performance of several storage solutions by finishing the same task, which creates a dataset (14 features/factors) from the basic OHLCV daily data of a stock market (800 stocks each day from 2007 to 2020). The task involves data queries and processing.

|  | HDF5 | MySQL | MongoDB | InfluxDB | Qlib -E -D | Qlib +E -D | Qlib +E +D |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Total (1CPU) (seconds) | 184.4±3.7 | 365.3±7.5 | 253.6±6.7 | 368.2±3.6 | 147.0±8.8 | 47.6±1.0 | **7.4±0.3** |
| Total (64CPU) (seconds) |  |  |  |  | 8.8±0.6 | **4.2±0.2** |  |

*   `+(-)E` indicates with (out) `ExpressionCache`
*   `+(-)D` indicates with (out) `DatasetCache`

Most general-purpose databases take too much time to load data. After looking into the underlying implementation, we find that data go through too many layers of interfaces and unnecessary format transformations in general-purpose database solutions. Such overheads greatly slow down the data loading process. Qlib data are stored in a compact format, which is efficient to be combined into arrays for scientific computation.

Your feedbacks about the features are very important.\n\nFramework of Qlib\n-----------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#framework-of-qlib)\n\n[![Image 73](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/raw/main/docs/_static/img/framework-abstract.jpg)](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/docs/_static/img/framework-abstract.jpg)\n\nThe high-level framework of Qlib can be found above(users can find the [detailed framework](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/introduction.html#framework) of Qlib's design when getting into nitty gritty). The components are designed as loose-coupled modules, and each component could be used stand-alone.\n\nQlib provides a strong infrastructure to support Quant research. [Data](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/data.html) is always an important part. A strong learning framework is designed to support diverse learning paradigms (e.g. [reinforcement learning](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/rl.html), [supervised learning](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/workflow.html#model-section)) and patterns at different levels(e.g. [market dynamic modeling](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/meta.html)). By modeling the market, [trading strategies](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/strategy.html) will generate trade decisions that will be executed. Multiple trading strategies and executors in different levels or granularities can be [nested to be optimized and run together](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/highfreq.html). At last, a comprehensive [analysis](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/report.html) will be provided and the model can be [served online](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/online.html) in a low cost.\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#quick-start)\n\nThis quick start guide tries to demonstrate\n\n1.  It's very easy to build a complete Quant research workflow and try your ideas with _Qlib_.\n2.  Though with _public data_ and _simple models_, machine learning technologies **work very well** in practical Quant investment.\n\nHere is a quick **[demo](https://terminalizer.com/view/3f24561a4470)** shows how to install `Qlib`, and run LightGBM with `qrun`. **But**, please make sure you have already prepared the data following the [instruction](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#data-preparation).\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#installation)\n\nThis table demonstrates the supported Python version of `Qlib`:\n\n|  | install with pip | install from source | plot |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Python 3.8 | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |\n| Python 3.9 | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |\n| Python 3.10 | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |\n| Python 3.11 | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |\n| Python 3.12 | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |\n\n**Note**:\n\n1.  **Conda** is suggested for managing your Python environment. In some cases, using Python outside of a `conda` environment may result in missing header files, causing the installation failure of certain packages.\n2.  Please pay attention that installing cython in Python 3.6 will raise some error when installing `Qlib` from source. If users use Python 3.6 on their machines, it is recommended to _upgrade_ Python to version 3.8 or higher, or use `conda`'s Python to install `Qlib` from source.\n\n### Install with pip\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#install-with-pip)\n\nUsers can easily install `Qlib` by pip according to the following command.\n\n**Note**: pip will install the latest stable qlib. However, the main branch of qlib is in active development. If you want to test the latest scripts or functions in the main branch. Please install qlib with the methods below.\n\n### Install from source\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#install-from-source)\n\nAlso, users can install the latest dev version `Qlib` by the source code according to the following steps:\n\n*   Before installing `Qlib` from source, users need to install some dependencies:\n    \n    pip install numpy\n    pip install --upgrade cython\n    \n*   Clone the repository and install `Qlib` as follows.\n    \n    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/qlib.git && cd qlib\n    pip install .  # \\`pip install -e .\\[dev\\]\\` is recommended for development. check details in docs/developer/code\\_standard\\_and\\_dev\\_guide.rst\n    \n\n**Tips**: If you fail to install `Qlib` or run the examples in your environment, comparing your steps and the [CI workflow](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/.github/workflows/test_qlib_from_source.yml) may help you find the problem.\n\n**Tips for Mac**: If you are using Mac with M1, you might encounter issues in building the wheel for LightGBM, which is due to missing dependencies from OpenMP. To solve the problem, install openmp first with `brew install libomp` and then run `pip install .` to build it successfully.\n\nData Preparation\n----------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#data-preparation)\n\n❗ Due to more restrict data security policy. The offical dataset is disabled temporarily. You can try [this data source](https://github.com/chenditc/investment_data/releases) contributed by the community.

You can start an auto quant research workflow and have a graphical reports analysis according to the following steps:\n\n1.  Quant Research Workflow: Run `qrun` with lightgbm workflow config ([workflow\\_config\\_lightgbm\\_Alpha158.yaml](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/benchmarks/LightGBM/workflow_config_lightgbm_Alpha158.yaml) as following.\n    \n      cd examples  # Avoid running program under the directory contains \\`qlib\\`\n      qrun benchmarks/LightGBM/workflow\\_config\\_lightgbm\\_Alpha158.yaml\n    \n    If users want to use `qrun` under debug mode, please use the following command:\n    \n    python -m pdb qlib/workflow/cli.py examples/benchmarks/LightGBM/workflow\\_config\\_lightgbm\\_Alpha158.yaml\n    \n    The result of `qrun` is as follows, please refer to [Intraday Trading](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/backtest.html) for more details about the result.\n    \n    'The following are analysis results of the excess return without cost.'\n                           risk\n    mean               0.000708\n    std                0.005626\n    annualized\\_return  0.178316\n    information\\_ratio  1.996555\n    max\\_drawdown      -0.081806\n    'The following are analysis results of the excess return with cost.'\n                           risk\n    mean               0.000512\n    std                0.005626\n    annualized\\_return  0.128982\n    information\\_ratio  1.444287\n    max\\_drawdown      -0.091078\n    \n    Here are detailed documents for `qrun` and [workflow](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/workflow.html).\n    \n2.  Graphical Reports Analysis: First, run `python -m pip install .[analysis]` to install the required dependencies. Then run `examples/workflow_by_code.ipynb` with `jupyter notebook` to get graphical reports.\n    \n    *   Forecasting signal (model prediction) analysis\n        \n    *   Portfolio analysis\n        \n        *   Backtest return [![Image 74: Report](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/raw/main/docs/_static/img/analysis/report.png)](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/docs/_static/img/analysis/report.png)\n    *   [Explanation](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/report.html) of above results\n        \n\nBuilding Customized Quant Research Workflow by Code\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#building-customized-quant-research-workflow-by-code)\n\nThe automatic workflow may not suit the research workflow of all Quant researchers. To support a flexible Quant research workflow, Qlib also provides a modularized interface to allow researchers to build their own workflow by code. [Here](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/workflow_by_code.ipynb) is a demo for customized Quant research workflow by code.\n\nMain Challenges & Solutions in Quant Research\n---------------------------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#main-challenges--solutions-in-quant-research)\n\nQuant investment is a very unique scenario with lots of key challenges to be solved. Currently, Qlib provides some solutions for several of them.\n\nForecasting: Finding Valuable Signals/Patterns\n----------------------------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#forecasting-finding-valuable-signalspatterns)\n\nAccurate forecasting of the stock price trend is a very important part to construct profitable portfolios. However, huge amount of data with various formats in the financial market which make it challenging to build forecasting models.\n\nAn increasing number of SOTA Quant research works/papers, which focus on building forecasting models to mine valuable signals/patterns in complex financial data, are released in `Qlib`\n\n### [Quant Model (Paper) Zoo](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/benchmarks)\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#quant-model-paper-zoo)\n\nHere is a list of models built on `Qlib`.\n\n*   [GBDT based on XGBoost (Tianqi Chen, et al.

Users can find the config files we provide and some details about the model through the [benchmarks](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/benchmarks) folder. More information can be retrieved at the model files listed above.\n\n`Qlib` provides three different ways to run a single model, users can pick the one that fits their cases best:\n\n*   Users can use the tool `qrun` mentioned above to run a model's workflow based from a config file.\n    \n*   Users can create a `workflow_by_code` python script based on the [one](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/workflow_by_code.py) listed in the `examples` folder.\n    \n*   Users can use the script [`run_all_model.py`](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/run_all_model.py) listed in the `examples` folder to run a model. Here is an example of the specific shell command to be used: `python run_all_model.py run --models=lightgbm`, where the `--models` arguments can take any number of models listed above(the available models can be found in [benchmarks](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/benchmarks)). For more use cases, please refer to the file's [docstrings](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/run_all_model.py).\n    \n    *   **NOTE**: Each baseline has different environment dependencies, please make sure that your python version aligns with the requirements(e.g. TFT only supports Python 3.6~3.7 due to the limitation of `tensorflow==1.15.0`)\n\n### Run multiple models\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#run-multiple-models)\n\n`Qlib` also provides a script [`run_all_model.py`](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/run_all_model.py) which can run multiple models for several iterations. (**Note**: the script only support _Linux_ for now. Other OS will be supported in the future. Besides, it doesn't support parallel running the same model for multiple times as well, and this will be fixed in the future development too.)\n\nThe script will create a unique virtual environment for each model, and delete the environments after training. Thus, only experiment results such as `IC` and `backtest` results will be generated and stored.\n\nHere is an example of running all the models for 10 iterations:\n\npython run\\_all\\_model.py run 10\n\nIt also provides the API to run specific models at once. For more use cases, please refer to the file's [docstrings](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/run_all_model.py).\n\n[Adapting to Market Dynamics](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/benchmarks_dynamic)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#adapting-to-market-dynamics)\n\nDue to the non-stationary nature of the environment of the financial market, the data distribution may change in different periods, which makes the performance of models build on training data decays in the future test data. So adapting the forecasting models/strategies to market dynamics is very important to the model/strategies' performance.\n\nHere is a list of solutions built on `Qlib`.\n\n*   [Rolling Retraining](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/benchmarks_dynamic/baseline)\n*   [DDG-DA on pytorch (Wendi, et al. AAAI 2022)](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/benchmarks_dynamic/DDG-DA)\n\nReinforcement Learning: modeling continuous decisions\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#reinforcement-learning-modeling-continuous-decisions)\n\nQlib now supports reinforcement learning, a feature designed to model continuous investment decisions. This functionality assists investors in optimizing their trading strategies by learning from interactions with the environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.\n\nHere is a list of solutions built on `Qlib` categorized by scenarios.\n\n### [RL for order execution](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/rl_order_execution)\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#rl-for-order-execution)\n\n[Here](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/rl/overall.html#order-execution) is the introduction of this scenario. All the methods below are compared [here](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/rl_order_execution).\n\n*   [TWAP](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/rl_order_execution/exp_configs/backtest_twap.yml)\n*   [PPO: \"An End-to-End Optimal Trade Execution Framework based on Proximal Policy Optimization\", IJCAL 2020](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/rl_order_execution/exp_configs/backtest_ppo.yml)\n*   [OPDS: \"Universal Trading for Order Execution with Oracle Policy Distillation\", AAAI 2021](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/rl_order_execution/exp_configs/backtest_opds.yml)\n\nQuant Dataset Zoo\n-----------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#quant-dataset-zoo)\n\nDataset plays a very important role in Quant. Here is a list of the datasets built on `Qlib`:\n\n| Dataset | US Market | China Market |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Alpha360](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/qlib/contrib/data/handler.py) | √ | √ |\n| [Alpha158](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/qlib/contrib/data/handler.py) | √ | √ |\n\n[Here](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/alpha.html) is a tutorial to build dataset with `Qlib`. Your PR to build new Quant dataset is highly welcomed.\n\nLearning Framework\n------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#learning-framework)\n\nQlib is high customizable and a lot of its components are learnable. The learnable components are instances of `Forecast Model` and `Trading Agent`. They are learned based on the `Learning Framework` layer and then applied to multiple scenarios in `Workflow` layer. The learning framework leverages the `Workflow` layer as well(e.g. sharing `Information Extractor`, creating environments based on `Execution Env`).\n\nBased on learning paradigms, they can be categorized into reinforcement learning and supervised learning.\n\n*   For supervised learning, the detailed docs can be found [here](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/model.html).\n*   For reinforcement learning, the detailed docs can be found [here](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/rl.html). Qlib's RL learning framework leverages `Execution Env` in `Workflow` layer to create environments. It's worth noting that `NestedExecutor` is supported as well. This empowers users to optimize different level of strategies/models/agents together (e.g. optimizing an order execution strategy for a specific portfolio management strategy).\n\nMore About Qlib\n---------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#more-about-qlib)\n\nIf you want to have a quick glance at the most frequently used components of qlib, you can try notebooks [here](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/examples/tutorial).\n\nThe detailed documents are organized in [docs](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/docs). [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/) and the readthedocs theme is required to build the documentation in html formats.\n\ncd docs/\nconda install sphinx sphinx\\_rtd\\_theme -y\n# Otherwise, you can install them with pip\n# pip install sphinx sphinx\\_rtd\\_theme\nmake html\n\nYou can also view the [latest document](http://qlib.readthedocs.io/) online directly.\n\nQlib is in active and continuing development. Our plan is in the roadmap, which is managed as a [github project](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/projects/1).\n\nOffline Mode and Online Mode\n----------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#offline-mode-and-online-mode)\n\nThe data server of Qlib can either deployed as `Offline` mode or `Online` mode. The default mode is offline mode.\n\nUnder `Offline` mode, the data will be deployed locally.\n\nUnder `Online` mode, the data will be deployed as a shared data service. The data and their cache will be shared by all the clients. The data retrieval performance is expected to be improved due to a higher rate of cache hits. It will consume less disk space, too. The documents of the online mode can be found in [Qlib-Server](https://qlib-server.readthedocs.io/). The online mode can be deployed automatically with [Azure CLI based scripts](https://qlib-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html#one-click-deployment-in-azure). The source code of online data server can be found in [Qlib-Server repository](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib-server).\n\nPerformance of Qlib Data Server\n-------------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#performance-of-qlib-data-server)\n\nThe performance of data processing is important to data-driven methods like AI technologies. As an AI-oriented platform, Qlib provides a solution for data storage and data processing. To demonstrate the performance of Qlib data server, we compare it with several other data storage solutions.\n\nWe evaluate the performance of several storage solutions by finishing the same task, which creates a dataset (14 features/factors) from the basic OHLCV daily data of a stock market (800 stocks each day from 2007 to 2020). The task involves data queries and processing.\n\n|  | HDF5 | MySQL | MongoDB | InfluxDB | Qlib -E -D | Qlib +E -D | Qlib +E +D |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total (1CPU) (seconds) | 184.4±3.7 | 365.3±7.5 | 253.6±6.7 | 368.2±3.6 | 147.0±8.8 | 47.6±1.0 | **7.4±0.3** |\n| Total (64CPU) (seconds) |  |  |  |  | 8.8±0.6 | **4.2±0.2** |  |\n\n*   `+(-)E` indicates with (out) `ExpressionCache`\n*   `+(-)D` indicates with (out) `DatasetCache`\n\nMost general-purpose databases take too much time to load data. After looking into the underlying implementation, we find that data go through too many layers of interfaces and unnecessary format transformations in general-purpose database solutions. Such overheads greatly slow down the data loading process. Qlib data are stored in a compact format, which is efficient to be combined into arrays for scientific computation.\n\nRelated Reports\n---------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#related-reports)\n\n*   [Guide To Qlib: Microsoft’s AI Investment Platform](https://analyticsindiamag.com/qlib/)\n*   [微软也搞AI量化平台？还是开源的！](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/47bP5YwxfTp2uTHjUBzJQQ)\n*   [微矿Qlib：业内首个AI量化投资开源平台](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/vsJv7lsgjEi-ALYUz4CvtQ)\n\nContact Us\n----------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#contact-us)\n\n*   If you have any issues, please create issue [here](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/issues/new/choose) or send messages in [gitter](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/qlib).\n*   If you want to make contributions to `Qlib`, please [create pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/compare).\n*   For other reasons, you are welcome to contact us by email([qlib@microsoft.com](mailto:qlib@microsoft.com)).\n    *   We are recruiting new members(both FTEs and interns), your resumes are welcome!\n\nJoin IM discussion groups:\n\n| [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/qlib) |\n| --- |\n| [![Image 75: image](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/raw/main/docs/_static/img/qrcode/gitter_qr.png)](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/docs/_static/img/qrcode/gitter_qr.png) |\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?screenshot=true#contributing)\n\nWe appreciate all contributions and thank all the contributors!
