[fix(refactor): prefix built-in node module imports](https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/41113599afb01040436dba993f06cacbdb8f8e13 "fix(refactor): prefix built-in node module imports
Since v5 relies on node >= 18, this is now possible (since v16, v14.18.0
[^1][^2]).
It's functionally irrelevant:
1. It's not required for CJS nor ESM (with a few exceptions [^3])
2. It has no performance promises
However, there are upsides to this approach:
1. It brings clear boundaries to what's a built-in and what's an
external dependency
2. It reduces the risk of importing unwanted deps where a built-in is
expected
3. It's slightly more interoperable with other JS runtimes that provide
node compatibility[^4], albeit only during development. Once imported
from npm, built-ins are assumed.

* add test for removing user provided expires
* rework impl and tests to ignore maxAge, do not set it
this is to take into account the built-in relative expires when passing
a maxAge to res.cookie
I realized that using maxAge to invalidate cookies inherrently hit this
relativee expires behavior, and the goal of this PR is not to rework
that relative expires behavior w/ maxAge, but to prevent users from
overwriting these values by accident when clearing cookies
* update history.md

Installation
------------

[](https://github.com/expressjs/express?screenshot=true#installation)

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Node.js 18 or higher is required.

If this is a brand new project, make sure to create a `package.json` first with the [`npm init` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file).

Installation is done using the [`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```shell
npm install express
```

Follow [our installing guide](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) for more information.

Docs & Community
----------------

[](https://github.com/expressjs/express?screenshot=true#docs--community)

*   [Website and Documentation](https://expressjs.com/) - \[[website repo](https://github.com/expressjs/expressjs.com)\]
*   [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/expressjs) for Official Middleware & Modules

**PROTIP** Be sure to read the [migration guide to v5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5)

Quick Start
-----------

[](https://github.com/expressjs/express?screenshot=true#quick-start)

The quickest way to get started with express is to utilize the executable [`express(1)`](https://github.com/expressjs/generator) to generate an application as shown below:

Install the executable. The executable's major version will match Express's:

```shell
npm install -g express-generator@4
```

Create the app:

```shell
express /tmp/foo && cd /tmp/foo
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Start the server:

```shell
npm start
```

View the website at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

Philosophy
----------

[](https://github.com/expressjs/express?screenshot=true#philosophy)

The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, websites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.

Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over 14 template engines via [@ladjs/consolidate](https://github.com/ladjs/consolidate), you can quickly craft your perfect framework.

Examples
--------

[](https://github.com/expressjs/express?screenshot=true#examples)

To view the examples, clone the Express repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/expressjs/express.git --depth 1 && cd express
```

Then install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Then run whichever example you want:

```shell
node examples/content-negotiation
```

available through the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).\n\nBefore installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Node.js 18 or higher is required.\n\nIf this is a brand new project, make sure to create a `package.json` first with the [`npm init` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file).\n\nInstallation is done using the [`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):\n\n```shell\nnpm install express\n```\n\nFollow [our installing guide](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) for more information.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n[](https://github.com/expressjs/express?screenshot=true#features)\n\n*   Robust routing\n*   Focus on high performance\n*   Super-high test coverage\n*   HTTP helpers (redirection, caching, etc)\n*   View system supporting 14+ template engines\n*   Content negotiation\n*   Executable for generating applications quickly\n\nDocs & Community\n----------------\n\n[](https://github.com/expressjs/express?screenshot=true#docs--community)\n\n*   [Website and Documentation](https://expressjs.com/) - \\[[website repo](https://github.com/expressjs/expressjs.com)\\]\n*   [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/expressjs) for Official Middleware & Modules\n*   [Github Discussions](https://github.com/expressjs/discussions) for discussion on the development and usage of Express\n\n**PROTIP** Be sure to read the [migration guide to v5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5)\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\n\n[](https://github.com/expressjs/express?screenshot=true#quick-start)\n\nThe quickest way to get started with express is to utilize the executable [`express(1)`](https://github.com/expressjs/generator) to generate an application as shown below:\n\nInstall the executable. The executable's major version will match Express's:\n\n```shell\nnpm install -g express-generator@4\n```\n\nCreate the app:\n\n```shell\nexpress /tmp/foo && cd /tmp/foo\n```\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```shell\nnpm install\n```\n\nStart the server:\n\n```shell\nnpm start\n```\n\nView the website at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)\n\nPhilosophy\n----------\n\n[](https://github.com/expressjs/express?screenshot=true#philosophy)\n\nThe Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, websites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.\n\nExpress does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over 14 template engines via [@ladjs/consolidate](https://github.com/ladjs/consolidate), you can quickly craft your perfect framework.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n[](https://github.com/expressjs/express?screenshot=true#examples)\n\nTo view the examples, clone the Express repository:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/expressjs/express.git --depth 1 && cd express\n```\n\nThen install the dependencies:\n\n```shell\nnpm install\n```\n\nThen run whichever example you want:\n\n```shell\nnode examples/content-negotiation\n```\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n[](https://github.com/expressjs/express?screenshot=true#contributing)\n\n[![Image 44: Linux Build](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f79814b532ab3892c0ce5a0b186ac8d8d7eaa3a8af10bb419c027bce267b9988/68747470733a2f2f62616467656e2e6e65742f6769746875622f636865636b732f657870726573736a732f657870726573732f6d61737465723f6c6162656c3d4349)](https://github.com/expressjs/express/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Image 45: Test Coverage](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/29e50f0d53f58b4ad1e75b8b194462a7d5ba5bec609c0425d18b647e6c08501f/68747470733a2f2f62616467656e2e6e65742f636f766572616c6c732f632f6769746875622f657870726573736a732f657870726573732f6d6173746572)](https://coveralls.io/r/expressjs/express?branch=master)\n\nThe Express.js project welcomes all constructive contributions.
