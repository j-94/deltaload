Since v5 relies on node >= 18, this is now possible (since v16, v14.18.0
[^1][^2]).
It's functionally irrelevant:
1. It's not required for CJS nor ESM (with a few exceptions [^3])
2. It has no performance promises
However, there are upsides to this approach:
1. It brings clear boundaries to what's a built-in and what's an
external dependency
2. It reduces the risk of importing unwanted deps where a built-in is
expected
3. It's slightly more interoperable with other JS runtimes that provide
node compatibility[^4], albeit only during development. Once imported
from npm, built-ins are assumed.

* add test for removing user provided expires
* rework impl and tests to ignore maxAge, do not set it
this is to take into account the built-in relative expires when passing
a maxAge to res.cookie
I realized that using maxAge to invalidate cookies inherrently hit this
relativee expires behavior, and the goal of this PR is not to rework
that relative expires behavior w/ maxAge, but to prevent users from
overwriting these values by accident when clearing cookies

[Replace Appveyor windows testing with GHA (](https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/f4bd86ed361ea9710ed0f7b4634e66c8e3b88b40 "Replace Appveyor windows testing with GHA (#5599)
This PR moves us off of Appveyor for windows testing.
We are now doing windows/linux testing on GHA. With the exception of iojs, which we are only testing on Linux and have split out to it's own workflow.

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Node.js 18 or higher is required.

If this is a brand new project, make sure to create a `package.json` first with the [`npm init` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file).

Installation is done using the [`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```shell
npm install express
```

Follow [our installing guide](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) for more information.

**PROTIP** Be sure to read the [migration guide to v5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5)

Quick Start
-----------

[](https://github.com/expressjs/express?screenshot=true#quick-start)

The quickest way to get started with express is to utilize the executable [`express(1)`](https://github.com/expressjs/generator) to generate an application as shown below:

Install the executable. The executable's major version will match Express's:

```shell
npm install -g express-generator@4
```

Create the app:

```shell
express /tmp/foo && cd /tmp/foo
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Start the server:

```shell
npm start
```

View the website at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

Philosophy
----------

[](https://github.com/expressjs/express?screenshot=true#philosophy)

The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, websites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.

Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over 14 template engines via [@ladjs/consolidate](https://github.com/ladjs/consolidate), you can quickly craft your perfect framework.

Examples
--------

[](https://github.com/expressjs/express?screenshot=true#examples)

To view the examples, clone the Express repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/expressjs/express.git --depth 1 && cd express
```

Then install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Then run whichever example you want:

```shell
node examples/content-negotiation
```
