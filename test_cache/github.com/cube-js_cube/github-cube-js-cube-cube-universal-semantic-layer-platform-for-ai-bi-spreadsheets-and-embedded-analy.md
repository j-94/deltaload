[feat: New style RBAC framework (](https://github.com/cube-js/cube/commit/ad81453757788784c785c7a75202f94a74ab4c26 "feat: New style RBAC framework (#8766)
This commit introduces a new style Role Based Access Control framework
for cubes. User can now define `accessPolicies` on Cubes and Views which
will be evaluated into `queryRewrite` and visibility rules.
This commit introduces a new config: `contextToRoles(context):
string[]`. It should return a list of user role names based on the
request context. Access Policies are defined per Cube x Role name like
```
access_policy:
- role: \"manager\"
conditions:
- if \"{ security_context.isNotSuspended }\"
row_level:
filters:
- member: `access_level`
operator: lt
values: [2]
member_level:
includes: \"*\"
excludes: [`top_secret_field`]
```
Each policy can define a `row_level` and `member_level` rules.
Row level rules can be defined as a list of filters or `allow_all: true`
Member level rules should specify a list of \"included\" members that the
user with a given role is allowed to see.
When evaluating Cube and View level policies:
- row level filters are joined via AND (least permissive policy wins)
- member level policy at the view always wins (you can expose a hidden
member of a Cube on a View)
Policies can reference `security_context` (lowercase) when evaluating
policy conditions and filter values.")[#8766](https://github.com/cube-js/cube/pull/8766)[)](https://github.com/cube-js/cube/commit/ad81453757788784c785c7a75202f94a74ab4c26 "feat: New style RBAC framework (#8766)

**Cube is the semantic layer for building data applications.** It helps data engineers and application developers access data from modern data stores, organize it into consistent definitions, and deliver it to every application.

_Learn more about connecting Cube to [data sources](https://cube.dev/docs/config/databases?ref=github-readme) and [analytics & visualization tools](https://cube.dev/docs/config/downstream?ref=github-readme)._

Cube was designed to work with all SQL-enabled data sources, including cloud data warehouses like Snowflake or Google BigQuery, query engines like Presto or Amazon Athena, and application databases like Postgres. Cube has a built-in relational caching engine to provide sub-second latency and high concurrency for API requests.

For more details, see the [introduction](https://cube.dev/docs/cubejs-introduction?ref=github-readme) page in our documentation.

Why Cube?
---------

[](https://github.com/cube-js/cube?screenshot=true#why-cube)

If you are building a data application—such as a business intelligence tool or a customer-facing analytics feature—you’ll probably face the following problems:

1.  **SQL code organization.** Sooner or later, modeling even a dozen metrics with a dozen dimensions using pure SQL queries becomes a maintenance nightmare, which leads to building a modeling framework.
2.  **Performance.** Most of the time and effort in modern analytics software development is spent providing adequate time to insight. In a world where every company’s data is big data, writing just SQL queries to get insight isn’t enough anymore.
3.  **Access Control.** It is important to secure and govern access to data for all downstream data consuming applications.

Cube has the necessary infrastructure and features to implement efficient data modeling, access control, and performance optimizations so that every application—like embedded analytics, dashboarding and reporting tools, data notebooks, and other tools—can access consistent data via REST, SQL, and GraphQL APIs.

Getting Started 🚀
------------------

[](https://github.com/cube-js/cube?screenshot=true#getting-started-)

### Cube Cloud

[](https://github.com/cube-js/cube?screenshot=true#cube-cloud)

[Cube Cloud](https://cube.dev/cloud?ref=github-readme) is the fastest way to get started with Cube. It provides managed infrastructure as well as an instant and free access for development projects and proofs of concept.

[![Image 45: Get started now](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/cc33ed73e0283b2bcd583a3acda0a3f4da81e495efadf60875397162d18ce08e/68747470733a2f2f637562656465762d626c6f672d696d616765732e73332e75732d656173742d322e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f66316631656163302d306234342d346334372d393336652d3333623563303665656466302e706e67)](https://cubecloud.dev/auth/signup?ref=github-readme)

For a step-by-step guide on Cube Cloud, [see the docs](https://cube.dev/docs/getting-started/cloud/overview?ref=github-readme).

### Docker

[](https://github.com/cube-js/cube?screenshot=true#docker)

Alternatively, you can get started with Cube locally or self-host it with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Once Docker is installed, in a new folder for your project, run the following command:

```shell
docker run -p 4000:4000 \
  -p 15432:15432 \
  -v ${PWD}:/cube/conf \
  -e CUBEJS_DEV_MODE=true \
  cubejs/cube
```

Then, open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) in your browser to continue setup.

For a step-by-step guide on Docker, [see the docs](https://cube.dev/docs/getting-started-docker?ref=github-readme).

is the semantic layer for building data applications.** It helps data engineers and application developers access data from modern data stores, organize it into consistent definitions, and deliver it

more about connecting Cube to [data sources](https://cube.dev/docs/config/databases?ref=github-readme) and [analytics & visualization tools](https://cube.dev/docs/config/downstream?ref=github-readme)._\n\nCube was designed to work with all SQL-enabled data sources, including cloud data warehouses like Snowflake or Google BigQuery, query engines like Presto or Amazon Athena, and application databases like Postgres. Cube has a built-in relational caching engine to provide sub-second latency and high concurrency for API requests.\n\nFor more details, see the [introduction](https://cube.dev/docs/cubejs-introduction?ref=github-readme) page in our documentation.\n\nWhy Cube?\n---------\n\n[](https://github.com/cube-js/cube?screenshot=true#why-cube)\n\nIf you are building a data application—such as a business intelligence tool or a customer-facing analytics feature—you’ll probably face the following problems:\n\n1.  **SQL code organization.** Sooner or later, modeling even a dozen metrics with a dozen dimensions using pure SQL queries becomes a maintenance nightmare, which leads to building a modeling framework.\n2.  **Performance.** Most of the time and effort in modern analytics software development is spent providing adequate time to insight. In a world where every company’s data is big data, writing just SQL queries to get insight isn’t enough anymore.\n3.  **Access Control.** It is important to secure and govern access to data for all downstream data consuming applications.\n\nCube has the necessary infrastructure and features to implement efficient data modeling, access control, and performance optimizations so that every application—like embedded analytics, dashboarding and reporting tools, data notebooks, and other tools—can access consistent data via REST, SQL, and GraphQL APIs.\n\n[![Image 44](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cube-js/cube.js/master/docs/content/old-was-vs-cubejs-way.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cube-js/cube.js/master/docs/content/old-was-vs-cubejs-way.png)\n\nGetting Started 🚀\n------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/cube-js/cube?screenshot=true#getting-started-)\n\n### Cube Cloud\n\n[](https://github.com/cube-js/cube?screenshot=true#cube-cloud)\n\n[Cube Cloud](https://cube.dev/cloud?ref=github-readme) is the fastest way to get started with Cube. It provides managed infrastructure as well as an instant and free access for development projects and proofs of concept.\n\n[![Image 45: Get started now](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/cc33ed73e0283b2bcd583a3acda0a3f4da81e495efadf60875397162d18ce08e/68747470733a2f2f637562656465762d626c6f672d696d616765732e73332e75732d656173742d322e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f66316631656163302d306234342d346334372d393336652d3333623563303665656466302e706e67)](https://cubecloud.dev/auth/signup?ref=github-readme)\n\nFor a step-by-step guide on Cube Cloud, [see the docs](https://cube.dev/docs/getting-started/cloud/overview?ref=github-readme).\n\n### Docker\n\n[](https://github.com/cube-js/cube?screenshot=true#docker)\n\nAlternatively, you can get started with Cube locally or self-host it with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).\n\nOnce Docker is installed, in a new folder for your project, run the following command:\n\n```shell\ndocker run -p 4000:4000 \\\n  -p 15432:15432 \\\n  -v ${PWD}:/cube/conf \\\n  -e CUBEJS_DEV_MODE=true \\\n  cubejs/cube\n```\n\nThen, open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) in your browser to continue setup.\n\nFor a step-by-step guide on Docker, [see the docs](https://cube.dev/docs/getting-started-docker?ref=github-readme).\n\nResources\n---------\n\n[](https://github.com/cube-js/cube?screenshot=true#resources)\n\n*   [Documentation](https://cube.dev/docs?ref=github-readme)\n*   [Getting Started](https://cube.dev/docs/getting-started?ref=github-readme)\n*   [Examples & Tutorials](https://cube.dev/docs/examples?ref=github-readme)\n*   [Architecture](https://cube.dev/docs/product/introduction#four-layers-of-semantic-layer)\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n[](https://github.com/cube-js/cube?screenshot=true#contributing)\n\nThere are many ways you can contribute to Cube!
