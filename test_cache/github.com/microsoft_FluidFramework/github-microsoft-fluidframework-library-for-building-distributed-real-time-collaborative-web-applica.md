`description`.

## Description
Updates some types in the legacy+alpha API surface of the
`@fluidframework/shared-object-base` package. Mostly improving type
safety by replacing `any` with `unknown`, and a few `any` with `void`
where that was the correct type.
Also updates some code in response to the changes above, like call sites
of the affected APIs now having to do casts themselves instead of
relying on the `any` they were getting before.
## Breaking Changes
The breaking changes affect only the legacy+alpha API surface.")

[Restore patch for API-Extractor (](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/6b810c6e260262efba6442df85de738834412ce3 "Restore patch for API-Extractor (#22484)
## Description
https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22474 Updated
API-Extractor including its patch. Some packages (like common-utils)
referenced that patch, while others (like server/routerlicious)
duplicated it.

We currently use lerna in some places in CI, but it is called via npx
and thus its depednencies are not locked to a particular version., This
means that lerna releases can break our pipelines. This PR removes lerna
from the client and build-tools pipelines, as well as the independent
package pipelines. Server release groups are left alone.
- Removes all lerna dependencies from the client and build-tools release
groups.
- `lerna ls --toposort` has been replaced by a new command, `flub list`.
The output of this command does not exactly match lerna's but it still
seems to be sorted appropriately.
- `lerna exec` uses in the pipeline have been replaced by `flub exec`.
- Adds a .releaseGroup file to the root of each release group. I
couldn't think of a simpler way to make the pipeline behave differently
for release groups vs. independent packages. This is needed because the
pack step in the pipeline uses the presence of the file to determine
whether it needs to pack multiple packages or not.
### Not included in this PR
Server release groups still use lerna. Changing them will be more
difficult because they build in a docker context that is rooted at the
release gropup root. I need to figure out a solution for them, so I'll
do that separately from this PR.

Follow up to https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22179,
addressing the same warning for the historian and gitrest pipelines

The same test files for the same dependencies show up in the builds for
routerlicious (server), historian, and gitrest, and the credscan file
was hardcoding the full path for the routerlicious case. Using path
\"suffixes\" is supported, so now those files are correctly skipped for
all three pipelines.")

There is nothing particularly Fluid-centric about the top-level API in
build-infrastructure; I just couldn't think of a better name at the
time. After discussion, we're going to call the top-level object a
BuildProject. The full hierarchy is now:
BuildProjects contain Workspaces contain ReleaseGroups contain Packages
This change required a lot of documentation updates and renaming other
related properties and functions beyond the BuildProject itself.
The package is private so these changes are safe.")[#22967](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22967)

Adjusts webpack-fluid-loader's setup for odsp/odsp-df to authenticate

considerable simplification of webpack-fluid-loader's middleware, since
it no longer needs to deal with the redirects associated with more
complex oauth flows. If we want to add support for that back in the
future at some point, I would also personally like to see it done via a
common auth library such as @azure/identity rather than our own
handcrafted setup.
This change is motivated by a desire to better separate entra app
registrations we use for different dev workflows against real services.
As such, running examples locally is now updated to use a distinct

The markdown-magic and changelog-generator-wrapper packages are both
private packages that we use in various places within the repo. We have
been using `file:` links to these packages in the root workspace, but
that causes `pnpm i` to always trigger resolution, which not only wastes
time, but produces unnecessary lockfile changes in some cases.
I left the markdown-magic package where it is to minimize the change,
since it has a build pipeline and we continue to use `file:`
dependencies in other places like docs.
changelog-generator-wrapper, on the other hand, was moved to
packages/tools. We can do the same for markdown-magic once its build
pipeline is disabled/removed.
Including these packages in the root workspace caused the following
changes:
- Some dependency versions were changed to match those used in the
client release group.
- The version of the packages was updated to match the client release
group version. These packages are not published so the version should be
irrelevant.")

Fluid
=====

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#fluid)

The Fluid Framework is a library for building distributed, real-time collaborative web applications using JavaScript or TypeScript.

Getting started using the Fluid Framework
-----------------------------------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#getting-started-using-the-fluid-framework)

You may be here because you want to...

*   Learn more about the Fluid Framework
*   Build a Fluid object

Documentation and guides can be found at [https://fluidframework.com/](https://fluidframework.com/).

Hello World repo can be found at [https://github.com/microsoft/FluidHelloWorld](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidHelloWorld).

Core Examples repo can be found at [https://github.com/microsoft/FluidExamples](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidExamples).

Have questions? Engage with other Fluid Framework users and developers in the [Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/discussions) section of our GitHub repo.

Using Fluid Framework libraries
-------------------------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#using-fluid-framework-libraries)

When taking a dependency on a Fluid Framework library's public APIs, we recommend using a `^` (caret) version range, such as `^1.3.4`. While Fluid Framework libraries may use different ranges with interdependencies between other Fluid Framework libraries, library consumers should always prefer `^`.

If using any of Fluid Framework's unstable APIs (for example, its `beta` APIs), we recommend using a more constrained version range, such as `~`.

Code structure
--------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#code-structure)

The core code for both the Fluid client packages _and_ the reference ordering service is contained within this repo.

The repo structure is somewhat unique because it contains several [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces): some for individual packages and some for larger collections which we call "release groups". The workspaces are versioned separately from one another, but internally all packages in a workspaces are versioned together.

These workspaces do not align with package namespaces, and also don't always correspond to a single directory of this repo.

Here's the list of release group workspaces:

*   client (previously known as "Fluid Framework Client" or "core") (Rooted in [./](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main). Configured by [./pnpm-workspace.yaml](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/pnpm-workspace.yaml))
    *   [./packages](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages) (Published in the `@fluidframework/` namespace, but some in `@fluid-tools` and unpublished packages in `@fluid-internal/`)
    *   [./experimental](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/experimental) (Published in the `@fluid-experimental/` namespace)
    *   [./examples](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/examples) (Not published, live in the `@fluid-example/` namespace)
    *   [./azure](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/azure). (Published in the `@fluidframework/` namespace)
*   routerlicious (Reference Fluid Ordering Service) (Rooted in [./server/routerlicious](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/routerlicious). Configured by [./server/routerlicious/lerna.json](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/routerlicious/lerna.json))
    *   [Packages](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/routerlicious/packages) (Published in the `@fluidframework/` namespace)
*   gitrest (Rooted in [./server/gitrest](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/gitrest). Configured by [./server/gitrest/lerna.json](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/gitrest/lerna.json))
    *   [Packages](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/gitrest/packages) (Published in the `@fluidframework/` namespace)
*   historian (Rooted in [./server/historian](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/historian). Configured by [./server/historian/lerna.json](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/historian/lerna.json))
    *   [Packages](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/historian/packages) (Published in the `@fluidframework/` namespace)
*   build-tools (Rooted in [./build-tools](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/build-tools). Configured by [./build-tools/lerna.json](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/build-tools/lerna.json))
    *   [Packages](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/build-tools/packages) (Published in a mix of `@fluidframework/` and `@fluid-tools/` namespaces)

Here's a list of other sets of other packages (each package within these groups is versioned independently, forming its own release group):

*   "Common" Packages: miscellaneous packages in the [./common](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/common) directory and published under the `@fluidframework/` namespace. Most of these (but not all) have "common" in their package name. Packages which are used by multiple other groups of packages (such as built tools, linter configs and protocol definitions) live here.
*   "Tools" Packages: miscellaneous packages in the [./tools](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/tools) directory and published under a variety of namespaces. Logically about the same as "Common", but most of the names include "tools" instead of "common".
*   Auxiliary Microservice Packages (supporting Routerlicious)
    *   [./server](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server) excluding routerlicious, gitrest and historian (Published in the `@fluidframework/` namespace)
*   [./docs](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/docs): The code and content for [https://fluidframework.com](https://fluidframework.com/).

Dependencies between packages in various layers of the system are enforced via a build step called [layer-check](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/build-tools/packages/build-tools/src/layerCheck). You can view the full list of packages and layers in [PACKAGES.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/PACKAGES.md).

*   Note: to update the contents of `PACKAGES.md` for local package changes, run `pnpm layer-check --md .`.

Setup and Building
------------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#setup-and-building)

Install the required tools:

*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
    *   \+ [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/)
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): install the version noted in in the [.nvmrc file](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/.nvmrc). See [NodeJs Installation](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#NodeJs-Installation) for details.

Clone a copy of the repo and change to the repo root directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework.git
cd FluidFramework
```

Enable NodeJs's [corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack/blob/main/README.md):

```shell
corepack enable
```

Run the following to build the client packages:

```shell
pnpm install
npm run build
```

You can use the experimental worker mode to get faster build time as well: `npm run build:fast`

See also: [Contributing](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#Contributing)

Build in VSCode
---------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#build-in-vscode)

To build Fluid Framework within VSCode, open the Fluid Framework repo folder as a work space and use Ctrl-Shift-B to activate the build task. It is the same as running `npm run build` on the command line.

NodeJs Installation
-------------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#nodejs-installation)

We recommend using nvm (for [Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) or [MacOS/Linux](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to install Node.js. This ensures you stay at the correct version while allowing other uses of NodeJS to use the (possibly different) versions they need side-by-side.

Because of a transitive dependency on a native addon module, you'll also need to ensure that you have the prerequisites for `node-gyp`. Depending on your operating system, you'll have slightly different installation requirements (these are largely copied from `node-gyp`'s [documentation](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#readme)):

### On Windows

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#on-windows)

The node installer should ask if you want to install "Tools for Native Modules." If you check the box for this nothing further should be needed. Otherwise, you can follow the steps listed [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejs-guidelines/blob/master/windows-environment.md#prerequisites)

### On Unix

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#on-unix)

1.  Python v3.7, v3.8, v3.9, or v3.10
2.  `make`
3.  A C/C++ toolchain (like [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/))

### On MacOS

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#on-macos)

If you've _upgraded_ your Mac to Catalina or higher, you may need to follow [these](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/main/macOS_Catalina.md) instructions.

1.  Python v3.7, v3.8, v3.9, or v3.10
2.  `XCode Command Line Tools`, which will install `make`, `clang`, and `clang++`
    *   You can install these by running `xcode-select --install` from a command line.

### Other Build Requirements

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#other-build-requirements)

*   Building [server/Routerlicious](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/routerlicious/README.md)
    *   Refer to that package's README for additional requirements.
    *   Note that these requirements do not affect all workflows (e.g. the one noted [above](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#building)), but will affect workflows that include the packages under `server` (e.g. `fluid-build --symlink:full`).

#### On Windows

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#on-windows-1)

*   Ensure that you have enabled running Powershell scripts by setting your environment's [Execution Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7.2).

### Other Build Commands

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#other-build-commands)

#### Building our docs

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#building-our-docs)

There are a few different areas in which we generate documentation content as a part our overall build.

1.  [fluidframework.com](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main)
    *   We build the contents of our public website from the `docs` directory under the root of this repo. See its [README](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/docs/README.md) for more details.
2.  Generated README contents
    *   We leverage a local tool ([markdown-magic](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/tools/markdown-magic/README.md)) to generate / embed contents in our various package-level READMEs. This is done as a part of a full build, but it can also be executed in isolation by running `npm run build:readme` from the repo root.
3.  API reports
    *   We leverage [API-Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) to generate summaries of our package APIs. This is done as a part of a full build, but it can also be executed in isolation by running `npm run build:api` from the repo root.

Common Workflows and Patterns
-----------------------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#common-workflows-and-patterns)

This section contains common workflows and patterns to increase inner dev loop efficiency.

### Build

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#build)

*   `pnpm install` from the root of the repository to install dependencies. This is necessary for new clones or after pulling changes from the main branch.
    
*   `pnpm run build:fast` from the root of the repository to perform an incremental build that matches the CI build process. Incremental builds tend to leave extra files laying around, so running a clean is sometimes needed to cleanup ghost tests
    
*   `pnpm run build:fast -- <path>` to build only a specific part of the repository.
    
*   `pnpm run build` within a package directory to build that package.
    
*   `pnpm run build:compile` for cross-package compilation.
    
*   `pnpm run format` to format the code.
    
*   `fluid-build --vscode` to output error message to work with default problem matcher in vscode. If `fluid-build` is not installed, please install it with `npm i -g @fluidframework/build-tools`.
    

#### Multi package setup

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#multi-package-setup)

*   `fluid-build -t build <NAME_OF_PACKAGES>` to build a multiple space-separated packages along with all their dependencies. If `fluid-build` is not installed, please install it with `npm i -g @fluidframework/build-tools`.

### Debug

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#debug)

*   You can also use the VSCode JS debug terminal, then run the test as normal.
    
*   Sometimes, uncommitted changes can cause build failures. Committing changes might be necessary to resolve such issues.
    

### Troubleshooting

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#troubleshooting)

*   `pnpm clean` if random build failures, especially with no changes
*   `git clean -xdf` to remove extraneous files if debugging becomes slow or hangs.

Testing
-------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#testing)

You can run all of our tests from the root of the repo, or you can run a scoped set of tests by running the `test` command from the package you're interested in.

Note: Some of the tests depend on test collateral that lives in a submodule here: [https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFrameworkTestData](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFrameworkTestData). You may choose to fetch that collateral into your local repository, which is required to run all the tests - otherwise some will be skipped.

First, ensure you have installed [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/). Then, from the repo root:

```shell
git lfs install
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Run the tests

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#run-the-tests)

Before running the tests, the project has to be built. Depending on what tests you want to run, execute the following command in the package directory or at the root:

```shell
npm run test
```

*   To run a single test within a module, add `.only` to `it` or `describe`. To exclude a test, use `.skip`.
    
*   You can use `ts-mocha` to quickly run specific test files without needing to make the whole project compile. For more details on test filtering using CLI arguments, refer to the [Mocha documentation](https://mochajs.org/#command-line-usage).
    
*   Our test setup generally requires building before running the tests.
    
*   Incremental builds may leave extra files, which can result in ghost tests. To avoid this, consider running a clean build with the following command:
    

```shell
pnpm clean <package>
```

This removes any leftover files from previous builds, providing a clean testing environment.

### Include code coverage

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#include-code-coverage)

```shell
npm run test:coverage
```

### Mimic the official CI build

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#mimic-the-official-ci-build)

Our CI pipelines run on Linux machines, and the npm scripts all have the `ci` prefix. To replicate the test steps from the CI pipeline locally, run the following commands for the packages or pnpm workspaces:

| Run | Non-Windows | Windows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR | `npm run ci:test` | `npm run test:report && npm run test:copyresults` |
| Official | `npm run ci:test:coverage` | `npm run test:coverage && npm run test:copyresults` |

### Run tests from within VS Code

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#run-tests-from-within-vs-code)

We've checked in [VS Code configuration](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/.vscode/launch.json) enabling F5 from a `spec.ts` file to run those tests if you set the debug configuration to "Debug Current Test".

Run it locally
--------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#run-it-locally)

### Single browser window, two panes

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#single-browser-window-two-panes)

_This will use an in-memory implementation of the Fluid server to sync between the two panes in the browser window._

*   Choose an example under `/examples`
*   Navigate to the example's directory, e.g. `/examples/data-objects/clicker`
*   `npm run start`
*   Browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to interact with two copies of the example side-by-side

### Multiple browser instances on the same device

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#multiple-browser-instances-on-the-same-device)

_This will run the local Fluid server implementation we call "Tinylicious", so you can sync between multiple browser instances._

First, start Tinylicious by running these commands from `/server/routerlicious/`:

```shell
pnpm install
```

Then these commands from `/server/routerlicious/packages/tinylicious`:

```shell
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
```

Then:

*   Navigate to the example of your choice (same as above)
*   `npm run start:tinylicious`
*   Browse to [http://localhost:8080,](http://localhost:8080,) copy the full URL you're redirected to, and open in a second window to collaborate

Tools
-----

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#tools)

### Prettier

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#prettier)

This repository uses [prettier](https://prettier.io/) as its code formatter. Right now, this is implemented on a per-package basis, with a [shared base configuration](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/common/build/build-common/prettier.config.cjs).

*   To run `prettier` on your code, run `npm run format` from the appropriate package or release group, or run `npm run format:changed` from the root of the repo to format only files changed since the main branch. If your change is for the next branch instead, you can run `npm run format:changed:next`.
*   To run `prettier` with [fluid-build](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/build-tools/packages/build-tools/README.md), you can specify "format" via the script argument: `fluid-build -t format` or `npm run build:fast -- -t format`

To ensure our formatting remains consistent, we run a formatting check as a part of each package's `lint` script.

#### VSCode Options

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#vscode-options)

Our [workspace configuration](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/.vscode/settings.json) specifies `prettier` as the default formatter. Please do not change this.

It is not configured to do any formatting automatically, however. This is intentional, to ensure that each developer can work formatting into their workflow as they see fit. If you wish to configure your setup to format on save/paste/etc., please feel free to update your [user preferences](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) to do so.

Notable setting options:

*   `format on save`
*   `format on paste`

[![Image 27: User editor formatting setting options](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54606601/217620203-0cb07007-0aaa-4e57-bc83-973ed4a3f2d7.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54606601/217620203-0cb07007-0aaa-4e57-bc83-973ed4a3f2d7.png)

### Git Configuration

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#git-configuration)

Run the following command in each of your repositories to ignore formatting changes in git blame commands: `git config --local blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs`

Developer notes
---------------

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#developer-notes)

### Root dependencies

[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#root-dependencies)

The root package.json in the repo includes devDependencies on the mocha and jest testing tools. This is to enable easier test running and debugging using VSCode. However, this makes it possible for projects to have a 'phantom dependency' on these tools. That is, because mocha/jest is always available in the root, projects in the repo will be able to find mocha/jest even if they don't express a dependency on those packages in their package.json. We have lint rules in place to prevent phantom dependencies from being introduced but they're not foolproof.

While Fluid Framework libraries may use different ranges with interdependencies between other Fluid Framework libraries, library consumers should always prefer `^`.\n\nIf using any of Fluid Framework's unstable APIs (for example, its `beta` APIs), we recommend using a more constrained version range, such as `~`.\n\nCode structure\n--------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#code-structure)\n\nThe core code for both the Fluid client packages _and_ the reference ordering service is contained within this repo.\n\nThe repo structure is somewhat unique because it contains several [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces): some for individual packages and some for larger collections which we call \"release groups\". The workspaces are versioned separately from one another, but internally all packages in a workspaces are versioned together.\n\nThese workspaces do not align with package namespaces, and also don't always correspond to a single directory of this repo.\n\nHere's the list of release group workspaces:\n\n*   client (previously known as \"Fluid Framework Client\" or \"core\") (Rooted in [./](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main). Configured by [./pnpm-workspace.yaml](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/pnpm-workspace.yaml))\n    *   [./packages](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages) (Published in the `@fluidframework/` namespace, but some in `@fluid-tools` and unpublished packages in `@fluid-internal/`)\n    *   [./experimental](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/experimental) (Published in the `@fluid-experimental/` namespace)\n    *   [./examples](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/examples) (Not published, live in the `@fluid-example/` namespace)\n    *   [./azure](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/azure). (Published in the `@fluidframework/` namespace)\n*   routerlicious (Reference Fluid Ordering Service) (Rooted in [./server/routerlicious](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/routerlicious). Configured by [./server/routerlicious/lerna.json](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/routerlicious/lerna.json))\n    *   [Packages](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/routerlicious/packages) (Published in the `@fluidframework/` namespace)\n*   gitrest (Rooted in [./server/gitrest](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/gitrest). Configured by [./server/gitrest/lerna.json](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/gitrest/lerna.json))\n    *   [Packages](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/gitrest/packages) (Published in the `@fluidframework/` namespace)\n*   historian (Rooted in [./server/historian](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/historian). Configured by [./server/historian/lerna.json](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/historian/lerna.json))\n    *   [Packages](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/historian/packages) (Published in the `@fluidframework/` namespace)\n*   build-tools (Rooted in [./build-tools](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/build-tools). Configured by [./build-tools/lerna.json](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/build-tools/lerna.json))\n    *   [Packages](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/build-tools/packages) (Published in a mix of `@fluidframework/` and `@fluid-tools/` namespaces)\n\nHere's a list of other sets of other packages (each package within these groups is versioned independently, forming its own release group):\n\n*   \"Common\" Packages: miscellaneous packages in the [./common](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/common) directory and published under the `@fluidframework/` namespace. Most of these (but not all) have \"common\" in their package name. Packages which are used by multiple other groups of packages (such as built tools, linter configs and protocol definitions) live here.\n*   \"Tools\" Packages: miscellaneous packages in the [./tools](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/tools) directory and published under a variety of namespaces. Logically about the same as \"Common\", but most of the names include \"tools\" instead of \"common\".\n*   Auxiliary Microservice Packages (supporting Routerlicious)\n    *   [./server](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server) excluding routerlicious, gitrest and historian (Published in the `@fluidframework/` namespace)\n*   [./docs](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/docs): The code and content for [https://fluidframework.com](https://fluidframework.com/).\n\nDependencies between packages in various layers of the system are enforced via a build step called [layer-check](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/build-tools/packages/build-tools/src/layerCheck). You can view the full list of packages and layers in [PACKAGES.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/PACKAGES.md).\n\n*   Note: to update the contents of `PACKAGES.md` for local package changes, run `pnpm layer-check --md .`.\n\nSetup and Building\n------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#setup-and-building)\n\nInstall the required tools:\n\n*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).\n    *   \\+ [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/)\n*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): install the version noted in in the [.nvmrc file](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/.nvmrc). See [NodeJs Installation](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#NodeJs-Installation) for details.\n\nClone a copy of the repo and change to the repo root directory:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework.git\ncd FluidFramework\n```\n\nEnable NodeJs's [corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack/blob/main/README.md):\n\n```shell\ncorepack enable\n```\n\nRun the following to build the client packages:\n\n```shell\npnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\n\nYou can use the experimental worker mode to get faster build time as well: `npm run build:fast`\n\nSee also: [Contributing](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#Contributing)\n\nBuild in VSCode\n---------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#build-in-vscode)\n\nTo build Fluid Framework within VSCode, open the Fluid Framework repo folder as a work space and use Ctrl-Shift-B to activate the build task. It is the same as running `npm run build` on the command line.\n\nNodeJs Installation\n-------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#nodejs-installation)\n\nWe recommend using nvm (for [Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) or [MacOS/Linux](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to install Node.js. This ensures you stay at the correct version while allowing other uses of NodeJS to use the (possibly different) versions they need side-by-side.\n\nBecause of a transitive dependency on a native addon module, you'll also need to ensure that you have the prerequisites for `node-gyp`. Depending on your operating system, you'll have slightly different installation requirements (these are largely copied from `node-gyp`'s [documentation](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#readme)):\n\n### On Windows\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#on-windows)\n\nThe node installer should ask if you want to install \"Tools for Native Modules.\" If you check the box for this nothing further should be needed. Otherwise, you can follow the steps listed [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejs-guidelines/blob/master/windows-environment.md#prerequisites)\n\n### On Unix\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#on-unix)\n\n1.  Python v3.7, v3.8, v3.9, or v3.10\n2.  `make`\n3.  A C/C++ toolchain (like [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/))\n\n### On MacOS\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#on-macos)\n\nIf you've _upgraded_ your Mac to Catalina or higher, you may need to follow [these](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/main/macOS_Catalina.md) instructions.\n\n1.  Python v3.7, v3.8, v3.9, or v3.10\n2.  `XCode Command Line Tools`, which will install `make`, `clang`, and `clang++`\n    *   You can install these by running `xcode-select --install` from a command line.\n\n### Other Build Requirements\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#other-build-requirements)\n\n*   Building [server/Routerlicious](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/routerlicious/README.md)\n    *   Refer to that package's README for additional requirements.\n    *   Note that these requirements do not affect all workflows (e.g. the one noted [above](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#building)), but will affect workflows that include the packages under `server` (e.g. `fluid-build --symlink:full`).\n\n#### On Windows\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#on-windows-1)\n\n*   Ensure that you have enabled running Powershell scripts by setting your environment's [Execution Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7.2).\n\n### Other Build Commands\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#other-build-commands)\n\n#### Building our docs\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#building-our-docs)\n\nThere are a few different areas in which we generate documentation content as a part our overall build.\n\n1.  [fluidframework.com](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main)\n    *   We build the contents of our public website from the `docs` directory under the root of this repo. See its [README](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/docs/README.md) for more details.\n2.  Generated README contents\n    *   We leverage a local tool ([markdown-magic](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/tools/markdown-magic/README.md)) to generate / embed contents in our various package-level READMEs. This is done as a part of a full build, but it can also be executed in isolation by running `npm run build:readme` from the repo root.\n3.  API reports\n    *   We leverage [API-Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) to generate summaries of our package APIs. This is done as a part of a full build, but it can also be executed in isolation by running `npm run build:api` from the repo root.\n\nCommon Workflows and Patterns\n-----------------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#common-workflows-and-patterns)\n\nThis section contains common workflows and patterns to increase inner dev loop efficiency.\n\n### Build\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#build)\n\n*   `pnpm install` from the root of the repository to install dependencies. This is necessary for new clones or after pulling changes from the main branch.\n    \n*   `pnpm run build:fast` from the root of the repository to perform an incremental build that matches the CI build process. Incremental builds tend to leave extra files laying around, so running a clean is sometimes needed to cleanup ghost tests\n    \n*   `pnpm run build:fast -- <path>` to build only a specific part of the repository.\n    \n*   `pnpm run build` within a package directory to build that package.\n    \n*   `pnpm run build:compile` for cross-package compilation.\n    \n*   `pnpm run format` to format the code.\n    \n*   `fluid-build --vscode` to output error message to work with default problem matcher in vscode. If `fluid-build` is not installed, please install it with `npm i -g @fluidframework/build-tools`.\n    \n\n#### Multi package setup\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#multi-package-setup)\n\n*   `fluid-build -t build <NAME_OF_PACKAGES>` to build a multiple space-separated packages along with all their dependencies. If `fluid-build` is not installed, please install it with `npm i -g @fluidframework/build-tools`.\n\n### Debug\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#debug)\n\n*   You can also use the VSCode JS debug terminal, then run the test as normal.\n    \n*   Sometimes, uncommitted changes can cause build failures. Committing changes might be necessary to resolve such issues.\n    \n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#troubleshooting)\n\n*   `pnpm clean` if random build failures, especially with no changes\n*   `git clean -xdf` to remove extraneous files if debugging becomes slow or hangs.\n\nTesting\n-------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#testing)\n\nYou can run all of our tests from the root of the repo, or you can run a scoped set of tests by running the `test` command from the package you're interested in.\n\nNote: Some of the tests depend on test collateral that lives in a submodule here: [https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFrameworkTestData](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFrameworkTestData). You may choose to fetch that collateral into your local repository, which is required to run all the tests - otherwise some will be skipped.\n\nFirst, ensure you have installed [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/). Then, from the repo root:\n\n```shell\ngit lfs install\ngit submodule init\ngit submodule update\n```\n\n### Run the tests\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#run-the-tests)\n\nBefore running the tests, the project has to be built. Depending on what tests you want to run, execute the following command in the package directory or at the root:\n\n```shell\nnpm run test\n```\n\n*   To run a single test within a module, add `.only` to `it` or `describe`. To exclude a test, use `.skip`.\n    \n*   You can use `ts-mocha` to quickly run specific test files without needing to make the whole project compile. For more details on test filtering using CLI arguments, refer to the [Mocha documentation](https://mochajs.org/#command-line-usage).\n    \n*   Our test setup generally requires building before running the tests.\n    \n*   Incremental builds may leave extra files, which can result in ghost tests. To avoid this, consider running a clean build with the following command:\n    \n\n```shell\npnpm clean <package>\n```\n\nThis removes any leftover files from previous builds, providing a clean testing environment.\n\n### Include code coverage\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#include-code-coverage)\n\n```shell\nnpm run test:coverage\n```\n\n### Mimic the official CI build\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#mimic-the-official-ci-build)\n\nOur CI pipelines run on Linux machines, and the npm scripts all have the `ci` prefix. To replicate the test steps from the CI pipeline locally, run the following commands for the packages or pnpm workspaces:\n\n| Run | Non-Windows | Windows |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| PR | `npm run ci:test` | `npm run test:report && npm run test:copyresults` |\n| Official | `npm run ci:test:coverage` | `npm run test:coverage && npm run test:copyresults` |\n\n### Run tests from within VS Code\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#run-tests-from-within-vs-code)\n\nWe've checked in [VS Code configuration](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/.vscode/launch.json) enabling F5 from a `spec.ts` file to run those tests if you set the debug configuration to \"Debug Current Test\".\n\nRun it locally\n--------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#run-it-locally)\n\n### Single browser window, two panes\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#single-browser-window-two-panes)\n\n_This will use an in-memory implementation of the Fluid server to sync between the two panes in the browser window._\n\n*   Choose an example under `/examples`\n*   Navigate to the example's directory, e.g. `/examples/data-objects/clicker`\n*   `npm run start`\n*   Browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to interact with two copies of the example side-by-side\n\n### Multiple browser instances on the same device\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#multiple-browser-instances-on-the-same-device)\n\n_This will run the local Fluid server implementation we call \"Tinylicious\", so you can sync between multiple browser instances._\n\nFirst, start Tinylicious by running these commands from `/server/routerlicious/`:\n\n```shell\npnpm install\n```\n\nThen these commands from `/server/routerlicious/packages/tinylicious`:\n\n```shell\npnpm run build\npnpm run start\n```\n\nThen:\n\n*   Navigate to the example of your choice (same as above)\n*   `npm run start:tinylicious`\n*   Browse to [http://localhost:8080,](http://localhost:8080,) copy the full URL you're redirected to, and open in a second window to collaborate\n\nTools\n-----\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#tools)\n\n### Prettier\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#prettier)\n\nThis repository uses [prettier](https://prettier.io/) as its code formatter. Right now, this is implemented on a per-package basis, with a [shared base configuration](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/common/build/build-common/prettier.config.cjs).\n\n*   To run `prettier` on your code, run `npm run format` from the appropriate package or release group, or run `npm run format:changed` from the root of the repo to format only files changed since the main branch. If your change is for the next branch instead, you can run `npm run format:changed:next`.\n*   To run `prettier` with [fluid-build](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/build-tools/packages/build-tools/README.md), you can specify \"format\" via the script argument: `fluid-build -t format` or `npm run build:fast -- -t format`\n\nTo ensure our formatting remains consistent, we run a formatting check as a part of each package's `lint` script.\n\n#### VSCode Options\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#vscode-options)\n\nOur [workspace configuration](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/.vscode/settings.json) specifies `prettier` as the default formatter. Please do not change this.\n\nIt is not configured to do any formatting automatically, however. This is intentional, to ensure that each developer can work formatting into their workflow as they see fit. If you wish to configure your setup to format on save/paste/etc., please feel free to update your [user preferences](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) to do so.\n\nNotable setting options:\n\n*   `format on save`\n*   `format on paste`\n\n[![Image 27: User editor formatting setting options](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54606601/217620203-0cb07007-0aaa-4e57-bc83-973ed4a3f2d7.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54606601/217620203-0cb07007-0aaa-4e57-bc83-973ed4a3f2d7.png)\n\n### Git Configuration\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#git-configuration)\n\nRun the following command in each of your repositories to ignore formatting changes in git blame commands: `git config --local blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs`\n\nDeveloper notes\n---------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#developer-notes)\n\n### Root dependencies\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#root-dependencies)\n\nThe root package.json in the repo includes devDependencies on the mocha and jest testing tools. This is to enable easier test running and debugging using VSCode. However, this makes it possible for projects to have a 'phantom dependency' on these tools. That is, because mocha/jest is always available in the root, projects in the repo will be able to find mocha/jest even if they don't express a dependency on those packages in their package.json. We have lint rules in place to prevent phantom dependencies from being introduced but they're not foolproof.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n[](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework?screenshot=true#contributing)\n\nThere are many ways to [contribute](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to Fluid.\n\n*   Participate in Q&A in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/discussions).\n*   [Submit bugs](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues) and help us verify fixes as they are checked in.\n*   Review the [source code changes](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pulls).\n*   [Contribute bug fixes](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nDetailed instructions for working in the repo can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/wiki).\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
