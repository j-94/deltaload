*   [README](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#)
*   [Apache-2.0 license](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#)

### Running

[](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#running)

```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Adding a page

[](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#adding-a-page)

Just add the title and path in `config.js`. Refer that file for more info.

### Adding GraphiQL component

[](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#adding-graphiql-component)

The common GraphiQL component can be used throughout the site, just include it in the `mdx` file you want and you can even pass a `query` to fill it with a default value.

### Adding suboptions (right sidebar)

[](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#adding-suboptions-right-sidebar)

Refer `schema.mdx` and make sure to add the `<a>` tag for each suboption and then look `config` to see how to add the options there.

### Deploy

[](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#deploy)

Build all tags with `pathPrefix` except master like -

```
yarn build --prefix-paths
```

Now add all versions build folder with folder name as their `version` and add that to the root folder which contains the build files of master. Remember to update the `URL` (baseurl) in `config.js` with the actual deployment url. Also update the `currentVersion` in `config.js` everytime a new version is created.
