*   [README](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#)
*   [Apache-2.0 license](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#)

### Running

[](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#running)

```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Adding a page

[](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#adding-a-page)

Just add the title and path in `config.js`. Refer that file for more info.

### Adding GraphiQL component

[](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#adding-graphiql-component)

The common GraphiQL component can be used throughout the site, just include it in the `mdx` file you want and you can even pass a `query` to fill it with a default value.

### Adding suboptions (right sidebar)

[](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#adding-suboptions-right-sidebar)

Refer `schema.mdx` and make sure to add the `<a>` tag for each suboption and then look `config` to see how to add the options there.

### Deploy

[](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#deploy)

Build all tags with `pathPrefix` except master like -

```
yarn build --prefix-paths
```

Now add all versions build folder with folder name as their `version` and add that to the root folder which contains the build files of master. Remember to update the `URL` (baseurl) in `config.js` with the actual deployment url. Also update the `currentVersion` in `config.js` everytime a new version is created.

license](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#)\n\n### Running\n\n[](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#running)\n\n```shell\nyarn install\nyarn start\n```\n\n### Adding a page\n\n[](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#adding-a-page)\n\nJust add the title and path in `config.js`. Refer that file for more info.\n\n### Adding GraphiQL component\n\n[](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#adding-graphiql-component)\n\nThe common GraphiQL component can be used throughout the site, just include it in the `mdx` file you want and you can even pass a `query` to fill it with a default value.\n\n### Adding suboptions (right sidebar)\n\n[](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#adding-suboptions-right-sidebar)\n\nRefer `schema.mdx` and make sure to add the `<a>` tag for each suboption and then look `config` to see how to add the options there.\n\n### Deploy\n\n[](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#deploy)\n\nBuild all tags with `pathPrefix` except master like -\n\n```\nyarn build --prefix-paths\n```\n\nNow add all versions build folder with folder name as their `version` and add that to the root folder which contains the build files of master. Remember to update the `URL` (baseurl) in `config.js` with the actual deployment url. Also update the `currentVersion` in `config.js` everytime a new version is created.\n\nAbout\n-----\n\nGraphQL Web\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#readme-ov-file)\n\n### License\n\n[Apache-2.0 license](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web?screenshot=true#Apache-2.0-1-ov-file)\n\n[Activity](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web/activity)\n\n[Custom properties](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web/custom-properties)\n\n### Stars\n\n[**7** stars](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web/stargazers)\n\n### Watchers\n\n[**23** watching](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web/watchers)\n\n### Forks\n\n[**6** forks](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web/forks)\n\n[Report repository](https://github.com/contact/report-content?content_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdgraph-io%2Fgraphql-dgraph-web&report=dgraph-io+%28user%29)\n\n[Releases](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web/releases)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1 tags](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web/tags)\n\n[Packages 0](https://github.com/orgs/dgraph-io/packages?repo_name=graphql-dgraph-web)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo packages published  \n\n[Contributors 13](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web/graphs/contributors)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   [![Image 16: @DebabrataBhattacharjee](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67476065?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/DebabrataBhattacharjee)\n*   [![Image 17: @vardhanapoorv](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13391028?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/vardhanapoorv)\n*   [![Image 18: @gja](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34746?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/gja)\n*   [![Image 19: @shrutika2110](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28863468?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/shrutika2110)\n*   [![Image 20: @MichaelJCompton](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13693742?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/MichaelJCompton)\n*   [![Image 21: @meghakumari](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1733437?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/meghakumari)\n*   [![Image 22: @akashjain971](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17386007?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/akashjain971)\n*   [![Image 23: @amaster507](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2472115?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/amaster507)\n*   [![Image 24: @arijitAD](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5843604?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/arijitAD)\n*   [![Image 25: @pawanrawal](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7247941?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/pawanrawal)\n*   [![Image 26: @Sankalan13](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20856963?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/Sankalan13)\n*   [![Image 27: @ajeetdsouza](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1777663?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza)\n*   [![Image 28: @NamanJain8](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24658249?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/NamanJain8)\n\nLanguages\n---------\n\n*   [SCSS 69.0%](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web/search?l=scss)\n*   [JavaScript 23.9%](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web/search?l=javascript)\n*   [CSS 6.1%](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web/search?l=css)\n*   [Shell 1.0%](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-dgraph-web/search?l=shell)\n\nFooter\n------\n\n[](https://github.com/ \"GitHub\")© 2025 GitHub, Inc.\n\n### Footer navigation\n\n*   [Terms](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service)\n*   [Privacy](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)\n*   [Security](https://github.com/security)\n*   [Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/)\n*   [Docs](https://docs.github.com/)\n*   [Contact](https://support.github.com/?tags=dotcom-footer)\n*   Manage cookies\n*   Do not share my personal information\n\nYou can’t perform that action at this time.",
