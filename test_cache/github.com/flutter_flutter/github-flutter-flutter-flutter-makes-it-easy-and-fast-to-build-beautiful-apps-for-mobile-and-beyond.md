[Auto-format Framework (](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/commit/5491c8c146441d3126aff91beaa3fb5df6d710d0 "Auto-format Framework (#160545)
This auto-formats all *.dart files in the repository outside of the
`engine` subdirectory and enforces that these files stay formatted with
a presubmit check.
**Reviewers:** Please carefully review all the commits except for the
one titled \"formatted\". The \"formatted\" commit was auto-generated by
running `dev/tools/format.sh -a -f`. The other commits were hand-crafted
to prepare the repo for the formatting change. I recommend reviewing the
commits one-by-one via the \"Commits\" tab and avoiding Github's \"Files
changed\" tab as it will likely slow down your browser because of the
size of this PR.

[Refactor `android_engine_test`, make it easier to debug/deflake local…](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/commit/e517ae34576b6be01cdd39760bb7b6902644bc3b "Refactor `android_engine_test`, make it easier to debug/deflake locally. (#161534)
The goal here is to have a great standalone `android_engine_test` suite
that [replaces
`scenario_app/android`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/160992).
No test is _functionally_ changed in this PR, but overview of changes:
- Finished renaming the suite `android_engine_tests` instead of
`flutter_driver_android`
- Added instructions and an environment variable for local generation of
golden-files (`UPDATE_GOLDENS=1`)
- Added explanations of the individual tests, where they live, and how
to run them locally
- Added a hybrid-composition (HC, not TLHC, which is already tested)
test
- Renamed \"other_smiley\" to \"surface_texture_smiley\" (and renamed the
original to \"surface_producer_smiley\")
- Removed unnecessary \".android\" suffix (we will not run this on
anything but Android)
- Added a `tool/deflake.dart` to run a test suite 10x (or custom) times
locally to try and determine flakiness
After this PR, I'll add flags to let you control variants and name the
screenshots accordingly, i.e.:
- API v34 or v35
- OpenGLES or Vulkan (will require an `AndroidManifest.xml` edit during
the test instrumentation)")

[Add pre-stable support for create on Windows (](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/commit/685e9d1e47d80bd3bd22d97e1774fa264930434c "Add pre-stable support for create on Windows (#51895)
Adds initial support for flutter create of apps and plugins. This is derived from the current FDE example app and sample plugin, adding template values where relevant.
Since the APIs/tooling/template aren't stable yet, the app template includes a version marker, which will be updated each time there's a breaking change. The build now checks that the template version matches the version known by that version of the tool, and gives a specific error message when there's a mismatch, which improves over the current breaking change experience of hitting whatever build failure the breaking change causes and having to figure out that the problem is that the runner is out of date. It also adds a warning to the create output about the fact that it won't be stable.
Plugins don't currently have a version marker since in practice this is not a significant problem for plugins yet the way it is for runners; we can add it later if that changes.

The build now checks that the template version matches the version known by that version of the tool, and gives a specific error message when there's a mismatch, which improves over the current breaking change experience of hitting whatever build failure the breaking change causes and having to figure out that the problem is that the runner is out of date. It also adds a warning to the create output about the fact that it won't be stable.
Plugins don't currently have a version marker since in practice this is not a significant problem for plugins yet the way it is for runners; we can add it later if that changes.
Fixes #30704")

[Move snippets package back into flutter repo (](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/commit/183bc158165dff729f439b01b79f3b43e07dff3c "Move snippets package back into flutter repo (#147690)
## Description
This moves the snippets package back into the Flutter repo so that API documentation generation can happen without the use of `dart pub global run` because `pub run` doesn't handle concurrency well.
The change modifies the dartdoc building process to include building an executable from the snippets tool and installing that in the cache directory for use during docs generation.
The snippets tool will reside in dev/snippets, where it originally resided before being moved to https://github.com/flutter/assets-for-api-docs.
The snippets code itself is unchanged from the code that is in https://github.com/flutter/assets-for-api-docs/packages/snippets.

Flutter is Google's SDK for crafting beautiful, fast user experiences for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

Documentation
-------------

[](https://github.com/flutter/flutter?screenshot=true#documentation)

*   [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/get-started/)
*   [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/)
*   [Development wiki](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/docs/README.md)
*   [Contributing to Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

For announcements about new releases, follow the [flutter-announce@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flutter-announce) mailing list. Our documentation also tracks [breaking changes](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes) across releases.

Terms of service
----------------

[](https://github.com/flutter/flutter?screenshot=true#terms-of-service)

The Flutter tool may occasionally download resources from Google servers. By downloading or using the Flutter SDK, you agree to the Google Terms of Service: [https://policies.google.com/terms](https://policies.google.com/terms)

For example, when installed from GitHub (as opposed to from a prepackaged archive), the Flutter tool will download the Dart SDK from Google servers immediately when first run, as it is used to execute the `flutter` tool itself. This will also occur when Flutter is upgraded (e.g. by running the `flutter upgrade` command).

About Flutter
-------------

[](https://github.com/flutter/flutter?screenshot=true#about-flutter)

We think Flutter will help you create beautiful, fast apps, with a productive, extensible and open development model, whether you're targeting iOS or Android, web, Windows, macOS, Linux or embedding it as the UI toolkit for a platform of your choice.

### Beautiful user experiences

[](https://github.com/flutter/flutter?screenshot=true#beautiful-user-experiences)

We want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being forced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework. Flutter's [layered architecture](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/inside-flutter) gives you control over every pixel on the screen and its powerful compositing capabilities let you overlay and animate graphics, video, text, and controls without limitation. Flutter includes a full [set of widgets](https://flutter.dev/widgets/) that deliver pixel-perfect experiences whether you're building for iOS ([Cupertino](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/widgets/cupertino)) or other platforms ([Material](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/widgets/material)), along with support for customizing or creating entirely new visual components.

[![Image 48: Reflectly hero image](https://github.com/flutter/website/raw/main/src/content/assets/images/docs/homepage/reflectly-hero-600px.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/src/content/assets/images/docs/homepage/reflectly-hero-600px.png?raw=true)

### Fast results

[](https://github.com/flutter/flutter?screenshot=true#fast-results)

Flutter is fast. It's powered by hardware-accelerated 2D graphics libraries like [Skia](https://skia.org/) (which underpins Chrome and Android) and [Impeller](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/impeller). We architected Flutter to support glitch-free, jank-free graphics at the native speed of your device.

Flutter code is powered by the world-class [Dart platform](https://dart.dev/), which enables compilation to 32-bit and 64-bit ARM machine code for iOS and Android, JavaScript and WebAssembly for the web, as well as Intel x64 and ARM for desktop devices.

[![Image 49: Dart diagram](https://github.com/flutter/website/raw/main/src/content/assets/images/docs/homepage/dart-diagram-small.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/src/content/assets/images/docs/homepage/dart-diagram-small.png?raw=true)

### Productive development

[](https://github.com/flutter/flutter?screenshot=true#productive-development)

Flutter offers [stateful hot reload](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/hot-reload), allowing you to make changes to your code and see the results instantly without restarting your app or losing its state.

[![Image 50: Hot reload animation](https://github.com/flutter/website/raw/main/src/content/assets/images/docs/tools/android-studio/hot-reload.gif?raw=true)](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/hot-reload) [![Image 51: Hot reload animation](https://github.com/flutter/website/raw/main/src/content/assets/images/docs/tools/android-studio/hot-reload.gif?raw=true)](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/hot-reload)[](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/hot-reload)

### Extensible and open model

[](https://github.com/flutter/flutter?screenshot=true#extensible-and-open-model)

Flutter works with any development tool (or none at all), and also includes editor plug-ins for both [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter) and [IntelliJ / Android Studio](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter). Flutter provides [tens of thousands of packages](https://pub.dev/flutter) to speed your development, regardless of your target platform. And accessing other native code is easy, with support for both FFI ([on Android](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/android/c-interop), [on iOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/ios/c-interop), [on macOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/macos/c-interop), and [on Windows](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/windows/building#integrating-with-windows)) as well as [platform-specific APIs](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/platform-channels).

Flutter is a fully open-source project, and we welcome contributions. Information on how to get started can be found in our [contributor guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n[](https://github.com/flutter/flutter?screenshot=true#documentation)\n\n*   [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/get-started/)\n*   [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/)\n*   [Development wiki](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/docs/README.md)\n*   [Contributing to Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nFor announcements about new releases, follow the [flutter-announce@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flutter-announce) mailing list. Our documentation also tracks [breaking changes](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes) across releases.\n\nTerms of service\n----------------\n\n[](https://github.com/flutter/flutter?screenshot=true#terms-of-service)\n\nThe Flutter tool may occasionally download resources from Google servers. By downloading or using the Flutter SDK, you agree to the Google Terms of Service: [https://policies.google.com/terms](https://policies.google.com/terms)\n\nFor example, when installed from GitHub (as opposed to from a prepackaged archive), the Flutter tool will download the Dart SDK from Google servers immediately when first run, as it is used to execute the `flutter` tool itself. This will also occur when Flutter is upgraded (e.g. by running the `flutter upgrade` command).\n\nAbout Flutter\n-------------\n\n[](https://github.com/flutter/flutter?screenshot=true#about-flutter)\n\nWe think Flutter will help you create beautiful, fast apps, with a productive, extensible and open development model, whether you're targeting iOS or Android, web, Windows, macOS, Linux or embedding it as the UI toolkit for a platform of your choice.\n\n### Beautiful user experiences\n\n[](https://github.com/flutter/flutter?screenshot=true#beautiful-user-experiences)\n\nWe want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being forced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework. Flutter's [layered architecture](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/inside-flutter) gives you control over every pixel on the screen and its powerful compositing capabilities let you overlay and animate graphics, video, text, and controls without limitation. Flutter includes a full [set of widgets](https://flutter.dev/widgets/) that deliver pixel-perfect experiences whether you're building for iOS ([Cupertino](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/widgets/cupertino)) or other platforms ([Material](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/widgets/material)), along with support for customizing or creating entirely new visual components.\n\n[![Image 48: Reflectly hero image](https://github.com/flutter/website/raw/main/src/content/assets/images/docs/homepage/reflectly-hero-600px.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/src/content/assets/images/docs/homepage/reflectly-hero-600px.png?raw=true)\n\n### Fast results\n\n[](https://github.com/flutter/flutter?screenshot=true#fast-results)\n\nFlutter is fast. It's powered by hardware-accelerated 2D graphics libraries like [Skia](https://skia.org/) (which underpins Chrome and Android) and [Impeller](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/impeller). We architected Flutter to support glitch-free, jank-free graphics at the native speed of your device.\n\nFlutter code is powered by the world-class [Dart platform](https://dart.dev/), which enables compilation to 32-bit and 64-bit ARM machine code for iOS and Android, JavaScript and WebAssembly for the web, as well as Intel x64 and ARM for desktop devices.\n\n[![Image 49: Dart diagram](https://github.com/flutter/website/raw/main/src/content/assets/images/docs/homepage/dart-diagram-small.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/src/content/assets/images/docs/homepage/dart-diagram-small.png?raw=true)\n\n### Productive development\n\n[](https://github.com/flutter/flutter?screenshot=true#productive-development)\n\nFlutter offers [stateful hot reload](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/hot-reload), allowing you to make changes to your code and see the results instantly without restarting your app or losing its state.\n\n[![Image 50: Hot reload animation](https://github.com/flutter/website/raw/main/src/content/assets/images/docs/tools/android-studio/hot-reload.gif?raw=true)](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/hot-reload) [![Image 51: Hot reload animation](https://github.com/flutter/website/raw/main/src/content/assets/images/docs/tools/android-studio/hot-reload.gif?raw=true)](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/hot-reload)[](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/hot-reload)\n\n### Extensible and open model\n\n[](https://github.com/flutter/flutter?screenshot=true#extensible-and-open-model)\n\nFlutter works with any development tool (or none at all), and also includes editor plug-ins for both [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter) and [IntelliJ / Android Studio](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter). Flutter provides [tens of thousands of packages](https://pub.dev/flutter) to speed your development, regardless of your target platform. And accessing other native code is easy, with support for both FFI ([on Android](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/android/c-interop), [on iOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/ios/c-interop), [on macOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/macos/c-interop), and [on Windows](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/windows/building#integrating-with-windows)) as well as [platform-specific APIs](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/platform-channels).\n\nFlutter is a fully open-source project, and we welcome contributions. Information on how to get started can be found in our [contributor guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nAbout\n-----\n\nFlutter makes it easy and fast to build
