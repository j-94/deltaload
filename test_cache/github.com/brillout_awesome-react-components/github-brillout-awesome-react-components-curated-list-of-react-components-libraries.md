üöÄ Absolutely Awesome React Components & Libraries
--------------------------------------------------

[](https://github.com/brillout/awesome-react-components?screenshot=true#-absolutely-awesome-react-components--libraries)

This is a list of AWESOME components. Nope, it's NOT a comprehensive list of every React component under the sun. So, what does "awesome" mean? Well:

*   It solves a real problem
*   It does so in a ü¶Ñ unique, ü¶ã beautiful, or üèÜ exceptional way. (And it's not super popular and well-known... no point in listing those.)
*   It has recent code commits!

Look for a üöÄ for truly amazing projects. And look for quickie maintainer commentary and reviews in _(italic parens)_ after some listings of note.

See also: [Awesome React Frameworks](https://github.com/brillout/awesome-react-frameworks).

Maintainers:

*   [@petebray](https://github.com/bluepeter), author of [Fluxguard](https://fluxguard.com/) ‚Äî monitor PROD website changes.
*   [@brillout](https://twitter.com/brillout), author of [Vike](https://vike.dev/) ‚Äî a fast Vite-based React framework that is flexible, lean, community-driven and dependable.
