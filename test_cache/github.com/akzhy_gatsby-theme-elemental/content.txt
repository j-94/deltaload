    }],
    // Your social profile links. The icons of the given social medias are available in the static folder. If you are adding a new item, include the icon in the static/images folder.

#### Creating new blog posts.

[](https://github.com/akzhy/gatsby-theme-elemental?screenshot=true#creating-new-blog-posts)

Open the `contents/blog` folder and create a new folder with the name you wish to see as the URL. Inside the folder create an `index.md` file and also include any files you wish to add.

The frontmatter should be of the below structure

```
---
title: Title of your post
date: 2019-06-29 <-- Date should be in the given format
template: blog <-- The template you wish to use. "blog" for blog posts
image: ./image.jpg <-- Image shown on the list pages and also used as open graph image
banner: ./banner.jpg <-- Banner shown in the blog post
description: The description shown in the listing page. Also used for SEO description.
---
```

If you don't want the blog section, simply delete everything inside the `contents/blog` folder. (Do not delete the folder itself)

#### Creating new portfolio posts.

[](https://github.com/akzhy/gatsby-theme-elemental?screenshot=true#creating-new-portfolio-posts)

Open the `contents/portfolio` folder and create a new folder with the name you wish to see as the URL. Inside the folder create an `index.md` file and also include any files you wish to add.

The frontmatter should be of the below structure

```
---
title: Title of your post
date: 2019-06-29 <-- Date should be in the given format
template: blog <-- The template you wish to use. "blog" for blog posts
image: ./image.jpg <-- Image shown on the list pages and also used as open graph image
description: The description shown in the listing page. Also used for SEO description.
---
```

Portfolio pages support the creation of grids.

To create a grid, follow the below structure

```
[row]
  [col]
    **Markdown**
  [/col]
[/row]
```

The columns will have equal width on wide screens, and will expand on smaller screens.

#### Creating miscellaneous posts

[](https://github.com/akzhy/gatsby-theme-elemental?screenshot=true#creating-miscellaneous-posts)

These posts follow the URL structure of `http://example.com/miscellaneous-post/`. They are useful for creating pages like `privacy-policy`

The "About" page is created as a miscellaneous post.

#### Contact Form

[](https://github.com/akzhy/gatsby-theme-elemental?screenshot=true#contact-form)

The contact form will only appear when you provide a URL to the `api_url` inside `contact`.

On form submission, a `post` request will be sent to the URL given with properties `name`, `email`, `message`. A response is expected in the form

```
{
    response: "success"
}
```

If response is "success" a "Message sent" message will be shown, otherwise an error message is shown.
