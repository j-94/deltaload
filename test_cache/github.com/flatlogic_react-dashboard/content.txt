[](https://github.com/flatlogic/react-dashboard?screenshot=true#quick-start)

#### 1\. Get the latest version

[](https://github.com/flatlogic/react-dashboard?screenshot=true#1-get-the-latest-version)

You can start by cloning the latest version of React Dashboard on your local machine by running:

```shell
$ git clone -o react-dashboard -b master --single-branch \
      https://github.com/flatlogic/react-dashboard.git MyApp
$ cd MyApp
```

#### 2\. Run `yarn install`

[](https://github.com/flatlogic/react-dashboard?screenshot=true#2-run-yarn-install)

This will install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed in [package.json](https://github.com/flatlogic/react-dashboard/blob/package.json) file.

#### 3\. Run `yarn dev`

[](https://github.com/flatlogic/react-dashboard?screenshot=true#3-run-yarn-dev)

This command will start the app with simultaneously with express server, set up your database, start local server XAMPP, opensever, or other tool to start database, connect to it in file

```shell
src > data > sequelize.js.
```

Also go to

```shell
src > data > schema.js 
```

and enable mutation. This preparation will enable to realize CRUD operations locally

### 4\. How to create db

[](https://github.com/flatlogic/react-dashboard?screenshot=true#4-how-to-create-db)

Create db. For instance name it "sequelize" and add posts table to it, your table should have same structure as you can see on the screenshot  
[![Image 22: table structure](https://github.com/flatlogic/react-dashboard/raw/master/table.png)](https://github.com/flatlogic/react-dashboard/blob/master/table.png)

> [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) — Node.js server  
> [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql) — GraphQL server and IDE

#### 5\. Run `yarn build`

[](https://github.com/flatlogic/react-dashboard?screenshot=true#5-run-yarn-build)

Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

Now you can open your web app in a browser, on mobile devices and start hacking. Whenever you modify any of the source files inside the `/src` folder, the module bundler ([Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)) will recompile the app on the fly and refresh all the connected browsers.

For more info please refer to [getting started](https://github.com/flatlogic/react-dashboard/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) guide to download and run the project (Node.js \>\= 6.5)
