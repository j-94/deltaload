Gatsby Typescript
=================

[](https://github.com/d4rekanguok/gatsby-typescript?screenshot=true#gatsby-typescript)

An alternative to the official typescript plugin, with [`ts-loader`](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader) & automatic type generation for your graphql queries (using [`graphql-code-generator`](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator))

* * *

> Hi there 👋 Are you just looking for a way to generate graphql types for your graphql queries?
> 
> `gatsby-plugin-graphql-codegen` is what you want. However, other maintainers and I haven't been able to keep this repo up to shape. Please have a look at @cometkim's [graphql-plugin-typegen](https://github.com/cometkim/gatsby-plugin-typegen) which does almost the same thing & better maintained. Still, ideas & PRs are all welcomed. If you'd like to help maintain this project, please feel free to reach out. Thank you, have a great day!

General Q&A
-----------

[](https://github.com/d4rekanguok/gatsby-typescript?screenshot=true#general-qa)

Here's a list of common questions I've seen since releasing this project. If you have a question that's not here, please don't hesitate to open an issue!

**Why use `gatsby-plugin-ts`?**Gatsby use `babel-preset-typescript` which strips type information out of your code without doing typecheck. `gatsby-plugin-ts` use `ts-loader`, so you don't have to (1) worry about the [caveats](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-typescript#caveats) of `babel-preset-typescript` or (2) use an IDE / code editor that can typecheck for you.

It also generate typings for your graphql queries, make it easier to strengthen your code.

If you're already using something like VSCode and/or don't want to do typecheck in production, you can toggle off the typecheck option.

**What's the difference between `gatsby-plugin-ts` and `gatsby-plugin-graphql-codegen`?**Originally belong to the same plugin, the codegen portion was extracted to `gatsby-plugin-graphql-codegen` so it can be used with the official typescript plugin. If you are already using `gatsby-plugin-ts`, you don't need `gatsby-plugin-graphql-codegen`.

**Should I check the generated type definition into git?**It's up to your preference.

**What is up with all the `Maybe<T>`?**It's due to Gatsby internal. There's an effort to [make typing more strict here](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/20069).

You also may find the new optional chaining & nullish coalescing operator in typescript 3.7 helpful to deal with this.

**Can I turn off type checking and/or type generating?**Yes! You can also use node env to determine whether to enable these features.

```js
// gatsby-config.js
{
  resolve: `gatsby-plugin-ts`,
  options: {
    codegen: false,
    typeCheck: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
  }
},
```

**My graphql queries returns `null`**Gatsby extract graphql queries statically and it only understand queries inside template literal. It's possible that tsc is transpiling your template literal to string concat quivalent. Check your `tsconfig.json` & make sure you have a setting similar to this:

```js
"compilerOptions": {
  "target": "ES2018",    /* or at least ES2015 */
  "module": "ESNext",    /* or at least ES2015 */
  "lib": ["dom"],             /* <-- required! */
  "jsx": "preserve",          /* <-- required! */
  "moduleResolution": "node", /* <-- required! */
  /* other options... */
}
```

**What if I have a mixed ts/js codebase?**You'd have to update your `tsconfig` with the below options:

```json
  "allowJs": true,
  "outDir": "./build"
```

The `outDir` option won't be used by ts-loader, but you may need it to satisfy vscode.

**Babel doesn't understand the new optional chaining & nullish coalescing syntax even though my IDE shows no errors**If you are using `gatsby-plugin-ts`, before you go off and install a bunch of babel plugins like a lot of tutorials suggest, check if your compilation `target` in `tsconfig.json` is too high (`ESNext` or `ES2019`).

With these targets, tsc will leave the new syntax as-is, which babel might not understand. Downgrade them to `ES2018` should fix the issue; also make sure _your_ IDE's typescript version is the same as the one listed in your `package.json` dependency.

**Can I write \`gatsby-node\` in typescript & have its queries typing generated as well?**Yes, but it's not easy at the moment. We're working on it; stay tuned!

**Typechecking causes \`gatsby develop\` to crash.**We're trying to pin down why this happens, please share your experience in [#36](https://github.com/d4rekanguok/gatsby-typescript/issues/36)

### Common warning & errors

[](https://github.com/d4rekanguok/gatsby-typescript?screenshot=true#common-warning--errors)

Gatsby recently moved plugins' fragments from `.cache` to `node_modules`. We currently support both paths, but sometimes it may cause conflict warnings & errors:

**\`warning: Unable to find any GraphQL type definitions for the following pointers ...\`**If you are annoyed by this warning, set the `documentPaths` options as below:

```js
// gatsby-config.js
{
  resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-graphql-codegen',
  options: {
    documentPaths: [
      './src/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
      './node_modules/gatsby-*/**/*.js',
    ],
  }
},
```

~We will remove the `.cache/fragments` path and bump gatsby peer dependency version in a later release.~

**Update**: Since 2.4.0, we've removed `.cache/fragments` & bump up gatsby peer dep.

**Duplicate identifier error: `Duplicate identifier 'GatsbyImageSharpFixedFragment'`**If you see this error please run a `gatsby clean` to remove fragments in `.cache`, or set the `documentPaths` options as below:

```js
// gatsby-config.js
{
  resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-graphql-codegen',
  options: {
    documentPaths: [
      './src/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
      './node_modules/gatsby-*/**/*.js',
    ],
  }
},
```

**Missing definition `Unknown identifier 'GatsbyImageSharpFixedFragment'` in a yarn/lerna monorepo**Are you using a monorepo? It's possible that the missing fragment's plugin is 'hoisted' (moved to workspace root's `node_modules`). A simple fix is use a `nohoist` config, supported by both lerna & yarn. Here's an example with yarn workspace, where `gatsby-transformer-sharp` is always installed in its project's `node_modules`.

in your root's `package.json`

```json
"workspaces": {
  "packages": ["packages/*"],
  "nohoist": [
    "**/gatsby-transformer-sharp"
  ]
}
```
