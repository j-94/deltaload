Tina is a headless content management system with support for **Markdown**, MDX, JSON, YAML, and more.

It comes with a GraphQL API:

*   Query your Markdown content like this 👉 `post.author.firstName`
*   Supports statically generated and server side rendered pages
*   Supports references between documents

Tina offers a live preview (optional and opt-in) that makes editing Markdown files very intuitive for less-technical people.
