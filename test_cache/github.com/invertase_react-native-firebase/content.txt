**React Native Firebase** is a collection of official React Native modules connecting you to Firebase services; each module is a light-weight JavaScript layer connecting you to the native Firebase SDKs for both iOS and Android.

React Native Firebase is built with four key principles in mind;

*   🧪 **Well tested**
    *   every module is extensively tested to \>95% coverage
*   👁 **Well typed**
    *   first class support for Typescript included
*   📄 **Well documented**
    *   full reference & installation documentation alongside detailed guides and FAQs
*   🔥 **Mirrors official Firebase Web SDK**
    *   functions as a drop-in replacement for the Firebase Web SDK in React Native
    *   maximizes cross-platform code re-usability e.g. re-using code on web platforms
