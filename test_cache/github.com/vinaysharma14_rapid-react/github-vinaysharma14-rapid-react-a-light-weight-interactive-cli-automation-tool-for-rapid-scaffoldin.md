About ℹ️
--------

[](https://github.com/vinaysharma14/rapid-react?screenshot=true#about-information_source)

[Rapid React](https://github.com/vinaysharma14/rapid-react) is an interactive CLI tool which automates the repetitive steps involved every time a new React app is setup. Usually developers 👨‍💻 go through a time consuming process which involves waiting for **create-react-app** to finish it's boilerplate setup, followed by installation of dependencies & dev dependencies, setup of folder structure, routing, state management, e.t.c. before it can finally start working on the app. 🚧

Well, now you can grab a cup of ☕ while **Rapid React** scaffolds the app for you! 😌

Rapid React 2.0 is out! 🎁
--------------------------

[](https://github.com/vinaysharma14/rapid-react?screenshot=true#rapid-react-20-is-out-gift)

[![Image 15: update-notification](https://github.com/vinaysharma14/rapid-react/raw/master/docs/images/update.png)](https://github.com/vinaysharma14/rapid-react/blob/master/docs/images/update.png)

Thanks for showing your love for **Rapid React** which has motivated further to work on some cool new features!

*   **Rapid React** has been re-written from [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) to [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) APIs. This would dramatically reduce the boilerplate code required to work with Redux and further cut down your development efforts. 🏋️

> This has been considered after an in-depth advice from [Mark Erikson](https://github.com/markerikson) who is a Redux maintainer. You may check his suggestions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/khhh49/introducing_react_rapid_a_light_weight/) which cover **RTK** as the recommended way to write Redux logic. This would be a **breaking change** for existing users.

*   Added support for Redux Thunk middleware!
    
*   A much more comprehensive and better looking version update notification!
    
*   A notification sound would play once the setup is complete! 🛎️
    

Features 🎉
-----------

[](https://github.com/vinaysharma14/rapid-react?screenshot=true#features-tada)

*   Get notification every time an update is available. ⚙️
*   Supports both [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). 😍
*   Installs both dependencies and dev dependencies.
*   Supports popularly used CSS preprocessor [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)! 🔥
*   Choose from commonly used folders (`assets`, `components`, `hooks`, `services`, `utils`, e.t.c.) to scaffold.
*   Scaffolds custom folder as well.
*   Choose preferred [export type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export): named/default. 🤔
*   Setups [routing](https://reactrouter.com/) with user defined routes.
*   Setups [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) state management with user defined reducers along with:
    *   [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
    *   [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)
    *   [Redux Logger](https://github.com/LogRocket/redux-logger#readme)
*   Setups [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) state management with user defined stores.
*   ...and much more! 🎉

Requirements ✅
--------------

[](https://github.com/vinaysharma14/rapid-react?screenshot=true#requirements-white_check_mark)

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your system.
*   An active internet connection for CLI to work.

Installation 🚀
---------------

[](https://github.com/vinaysharma14/rapid-react?screenshot=true#installation-rocket)

From your terminal run:

# install the package from NPM
$ npm install rapid-react

Documentation 📗
----------------

[](https://github.com/vinaysharma14/rapid-react?screenshot=true#documentation-green_book)

**Rapid React** installs `rapid-react` command in your system. To run the tool, you need to invoke this command from your terminal:

# that's it!
$ rapid-react

As soon as run the command you are greeted by the CLI.

[![Image 16: greetings-screenshot](https://github.com/vinaysharma14/rapid-react/raw/master/docs/images/greetings.png)](https://github.com/vinaysharma14/rapid-react/blob/master/docs/images/greetings.png)

From there on, you are asked a couple of question for a tailored experience for your app setup.

[![Image 17: walk-through-screenshot](https://github.com/vinaysharma14/rapid-react/raw/master/docs/images/walk-through.png)](https://github.com/vinaysharma14/rapid-react/blob/master/docs/images/walk-through.png)

The utility would walk you through from following:

*   **Language Preference**  
    Choose between JavaScript and TypeScript
    
*   **App Name**  
    Enter your app name. By default it fallbacks to _my-app_.
    
    ✅ valid app names  
    foo  
    123foo  
    foo123  
    foo-bar
    
    ❌ invalid app names  
    Foo  
    Foo-Bar  
    FooBar
    
*   **Export Type Preference**  
    Choose between Named and Default.
    
*   **StyleSheet Preference**  
    Choose between CSS and SCSS.
    
*   **Routing requirement**  
    Choose either Yes or No.
    
    *   **If required, enter space separated route names**  
        e.g. `home login about signIn signUp`
        
        ✅ valid route names  
        foo  
        fooBar  
        FooBar  
        Foo123
        
        ❌ invalid route names  
        123foo  
        foo-bar  
        foo.bar  
        foo?bar
        
*   **State management requirement**  
    Choose either Yes or No.
    
    *   **If required, select one**  
        Choose between MobX and Redux. Once chosen you'll be prompted to **enter space separated** names of stores(in case of MobX) or reducers(in case of Redux). The conventions would be same as routes.
        
    *   **Installing additional Redux libraries**  
        If you chose Redux you'll be prompted to choose from these additional libraries usually used with Redux:
        
        *   Redux Logger
        *   Redux Thunk
        *   Redux Saga
*   **Scaffold folders**:
    
    *   **Standard**  
        You can choose from commonly used folder to scaffold: `assets`, `components`, `data`, `errors`, `fallbacks`, `hooks`, `layouts`, `services`, `types`, `utils`, `validations`.
    *   **Custom**  
        You can **enter space separated** folders. The conventions would be same as routes.
*   **Dependencies**:  
    You can **enter space separated** dependencies. The conventions would be same as routes. E.g. `antd lodash moment`.  
    ⚠️ In case you are using **TypeScript** you'll have to explicitly mention type definition packages required for these dependencies. Such packages usually start with `@types/` prefix and are installed as dev dependencies.
    
*   **Dev Dependencies**: You can **enter space separated** dev dependencies. The conventions would be same as routes. If you're not sure about what a dev dependency is, you can refer to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22004559/11220479).
