[Use a test PostgreSQL image based on Debian, not Alpine.](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/commit/b8d7c6039bce5bc4e2373186ec737b215ea7dd3e "Use a test PostgreSQL image based on Debian, not Alpine.
Alpine is often slower than Debian (because musl is sometimes slower than glibc) and not how anyone actually deploys PostgreSQL in production.
Most notably, some floating-point computations result in slightly different values, and Debian ships with better support for different locales so sorting text (e.g. with `ORDER BY`) behaves differently.
Let's test against an environment that people are likely to actually use.
As a result, there are slight changes to the results of PostGIS computations in a couple of test cases.

[Fix](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/commit/4d86cd3a62e693b4257e2812ce71ae02ce226e19 "Fix #9447 bad memory usage
A fix for #9447
Before this change, for the workload in the ticket, we saw a memory stay at around 4 GB an hour after the workload ended.  after this change we see both a lower memory high watermark, and also see memory come back to baseline at the end as we expect (after the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_PG_CONN_LIFETIME` and a subsequent `_idleStaleReaperThread` interval elapses).  But note the numbers given on any given machine may be slightly different, since the behavior depends on the version of glibc and processor speed (Since the test case depends on the server being overloaded).
This might also help some users commenting in https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/9592

Now that Docker for macOS supports using Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation, we no longer need to use the `azure-sql-edge` image. We can always use the official `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server` one.
This also means that we no longer need the separate healthcheck container, because the official image ships with `sqlcmd`.
When this is merged, you will need to ensure you have enabled Rosetta emulation in the Docker settings to test against SQL Server on macOS. This requires macOS 13 (Ventura).

This adds linting and formatting of frontend code when running `make lint`, `make format`, or any of the variations.
I am adding this because I didn't know how to check the code and so I had to wait for CI to fail, which I found irritating.
In order to make this reasonable, I factored out `make` targets for building *frontend/node_modules*, so I could depend on them.

We clearly do need this environment variable (at least on macOS); otherwise GHC spits out a slew of errors along the lines of \"cannot find libodbc.dylib\".
However, adding it directly to the shell causes serious problems. Wrapping GHC should limit the damage.
We've seen similar issues on macOS.

There is already a library in Hackage called \"error-message\".
This breaks the Nix build as we end up overriding that library, which causes a change to any of its dependents.
Outside Nix, Shadowing isn't strictly a problem, but it's prudent to avoid it in case we accidentally end up with the other library in edge cases.

Hasura GraphQL Engine
=====================

[](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine?screenshot=true#hasura-graphql-engine)

The Hasura engine is an open source project which supercharges the building of modern applications by providing access to data via a single, composable, secure API endpoint.

The future of data delivery is GA: Supporting PostgreSQL (and its flavors), MongoDB, ClickHouse, and MS SQL Server. Also supports writing custom business logic using the Typescript, Python, and Go Connector SDKs. Here is the recommended [Getting Started](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/quickstart/) guide on DDN.

The Hasura v3 engine code, which powers Hasura DDN, is in the `v3` folder of this repo. You can find more detailed information about in this [v3 README](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/blob/master/v3/README.md).

The Hasura DDN architecture includes Data Connectors to connect to data sources. All Hasura connectors are also available completely open source. Check out the [Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors/) which lists all available connectors.

Cloning repository
------------------

[](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine?screenshot=true#cloning-repository)

This repository is a large and active mono-repo containing many parts of the Hasura ecosystem and a long git history, that can make the first time cloning of the repository slow and consume a lot of disk space. We recommend following if you are facing cloning issues.

### Shallow clone

[](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine?screenshot=true#shallow-clone)

This will only clone the latest commit and ignore all historical commits.

```
git clone https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine.git --depth 1
```

### Git checkout with only Hasura V3 engine code

[](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine?screenshot=true#git-checkout-with-only-hasura-v3-engine-code)

```
git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine.git --depth 1
cd graphql-engine
git sparse-checkout init --cone
git sparse-checkout set v3
git checkout @
```

This checkouts the top level files and only the `v3` folder which contains the Hasura V3 Engine code.
