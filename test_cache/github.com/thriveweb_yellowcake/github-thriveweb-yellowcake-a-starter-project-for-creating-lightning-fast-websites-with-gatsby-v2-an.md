An opinionated starter project for creating lightning-fast websites with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/) v2 and [Netlify CMS](https://netlifycms.org/) v2. Made by [Thrive Web Design on the Gold Coast, Australia](https://thriveweb.com.au/)

*   **[Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/)** static site generator
*   **[Netlify CMS](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms)** for content management

Get going
---------

[](https://github.com/thriveweb/yellowcake?screenshot=true#get-going)

[![Image 25: Deploy to Netlify](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8ef0cc1d083b2d67eb72500031401d9b52c3ecb9fb4c4405f46afd0d0aba02d6/68747470733a2f2f7777772e6e65746c6966792e636f6d2f696d672f6465706c6f792f627574746f6e2e737667)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/thriveweb/yellowcake&stack=cms)

1.  Hit the **Deploy to Netlify** button. This will:

*   Clone the repo into your Github account
*   Create you a new project on Netlify, build & deploy

1.  Once your Netlify project has been created, check a couple of settings:

*   Enable **Identity**
*   Change **Registration Preferences** to **Invite Only**
*   Enable **Git Gateway**

1.  Invite users (probably yourself) to enable admin access

*   Open the **Identity** tab and hit **Invite Users**

Show me the CMS!
----------------

[](https://github.com/thriveweb/yellowcake?screenshot=true#show-me-the-cms)

The CMS lives at [\_\_YOUR\_SITE\_NAME\_\_.netlify.com/admin](https://__your_site_name__.netlify.com/admin).

Developing
----------

[](https://github.com/thriveweb/yellowcake?screenshot=true#developing)

1.  Clone your repo to your local machine
    
2.  Install dependencies
    

`yarn` or `npm install`

1.  Run the development server

`yarn start` or `npm run start`

If you are adding or editing content locally in the CMS, a couple of things to note:

1.  Changes will be pushed to the remote repo.
    
2.  You will be prompted to enter your site's url, this is necessary for Netlify Identity to manage user login. This is stored in `localStorage`, so you might have to empty your browser cache if you are switching projects but remaining on `localhost:8000`.
    

Editing CMS fields
------------------

[](https://github.com/thriveweb/yellowcake?screenshot=true#editing-cms-fields)

The Netlify CMS configuration is located in `public/admin/config.yml`. This is where you will configure the pages, fields, posts and settings that are editable by the CMS.

Find out more in the [Netlify CMS Docs](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/#configuration).

Uploadcare setup
----------------

[](https://github.com/thriveweb/yellowcake?screenshot=true#uploadcare-setup)

Uploadcare is our file upload system. It hosts the files for us and delivers them trough their CDN network. Each site you'll create need its own Uploadcare API key's. See below how to set this up

1.  Create new project in Uploadcare and save API keys in project

*   Go to [Uploadcare.com](https://uploadcare.com/accounts/login/) and login
*   Once on the dashboard create a new project
*   Set the name and hit create
*   In the left menu click in API Keys and copy the public key
*   Create an environment variable GATSBY\_UPLOADCARE\_PUBLIC\_KEY and supply it with the Public Key from Uploadcare
*   Done!!

For more details see the [Netlify CMS Docs](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/uploadcare/)

Scheduled content
-----------------

[](https://github.com/thriveweb/yellowcake?screenshot=true#scheduled-content)

Scheduled content allows you to schedule posts. Set the date / order field in a post to the feature. For the scheduled content to appear on the website we need to deploy our website daily.

1.  Setup a Netlify build hook

*   Go to [https://app.netlify.com/sites/\_YOUR\_SITE\_NAME/setings/deploys/#build-hooks](https://app.netlify.com/sites/_YOUR_SITE_NAME/setings/deploys/#build-hooks)
*   Hit build hook button in the build hooks section
*   Give it a name for example: "Automatic deploy Zapier"
*   Select branch, in most cases master will do.
*   Hit save and copy the generated url

2.  Zapier Setup

*   Go to [Zapier.com](https://zapier.com/) and login
*   Hit make a zap button in the right top corner
*   Search for Schedule in the search bar and select "Schedule by Zapier"
*   Check every day and hit continue

opinionated starter project for creating lightning-fast websites with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/) v2 and [Netlify CMS](https://netlifycms.org/) v2. Made by [Thrive Web Design on the Gold Coast, Australia](https://thriveweb.com.au/)\n\n*   **[Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/)** static site generator\n*   **[Netlify CMS](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms)** for content management\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[](https://github.com/thriveweb/yellowcake?screenshot=true#see-also)\n\n[Netlify CMS Docs](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/)  \n[Netlify CMS Repo](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms)\n\nGet going\n---------\n\n[](https://github.com/thriveweb/yellowcake?screenshot=true#get-going)\n\n[![Image 25: Deploy to Netlify](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8ef0cc1d083b2d67eb72500031401d9b52c3ecb9fb4c4405f46afd0d0aba02d6/68747470733a2f2f7777772e6e65746c6966792e636f6d2f696d672f6465706c6f792f627574746f6e2e737667)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/thriveweb/yellowcake&stack=cms)\n\n1.  Hit the **Deploy to Netlify** button. This will:\n\n*   Clone the repo into your Github account\n*   Create you a new project on Netlify, build & deploy\n\n1.  Once your Netlify project has been created, check a couple of settings:\n\n*   Enable **Identity**\n*   Change **Registration Preferences** to **Invite Only**\n*   Enable **Git Gateway**\n\n1.  Invite users (probably yourself) to enable admin access\n\n*   Open the **Identity** tab and hit **Invite Users**\n\nShow me the CMS!\n----------------\n\n[](https://github.com/thriveweb/yellowcake?screenshot=true#show-me-the-cms)\n\nThe CMS lives at [\\_\\_YOUR\\_SITE\\_NAME\\_\\_.netlify.com/admin](https://__your_site_name__.netlify.com/admin).\n\nDeveloping\n----------\n\n[](https://github.com/thriveweb/yellowcake?screenshot=true#developing)\n\n1.  Clone your repo to your local machine\n    \n2.  Install dependencies\n    \n\n`yarn` or `npm install`\n\n1.  Run the development server\n\n`yarn start` or `npm run start`\n\nIf you are adding or editing content locally in the CMS, a couple of things to note:\n\n1.  Changes will be pushed to the remote repo.\n    \n2.  You will be prompted to enter your site's url, this is necessary for Netlify Identity to manage user login. This is stored in `localStorage`, so you might have to empty your browser cache if you are switching projects but remaining on `localhost:8000`.\n    \n\nEditing CMS fields\n------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/thriveweb/yellowcake?screenshot=true#editing-cms-fields)\n\nThe Netlify CMS configuration is located in `public/admin/config.yml`. This is where you will configure the pages, fields, posts and settings that are editable by the CMS.\n\nFind out more in the [Netlify CMS Docs](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/#configuration).\n\nUploadcare setup\n----------------\n\n[](https://github.com/thriveweb/yellowcake?screenshot=true#uploadcare-setup)\n\nUploadcare is our file upload system. It hosts the files for us and delivers them trough their CDN network. Each site you'll create need its own Uploadcare API key's. See below how to set this up\n\n1.

Set the date / order field in a post to the feature. For the scheduled content to appear on the website we need to deploy our website daily.\n\n1.  Setup a Netlify build hook\n\n*   Go to [https://app.netlify.com/sites/\\_YOUR\\_SITE\\_NAME/setings/deploys/#build-hooks](https://app.netlify.com/sites/_YOUR_SITE_NAME/setings/deploys/#build-hooks)\n*   Hit build hook button in the build hooks section\n*   Give it a name for example: \"Automatic deploy Zapier\"\n*   Select branch, in most cases master will do.\n*   Hit save and copy the generated url\n\n2.

Yellowcake\" and make sure your zap is turned on\n\nThat's it, you'r now ready to use scheduled content!!\n\nMailchimp
