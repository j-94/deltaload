Next Right Now
--------------

[](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now?screenshot=true#next-right-now)

Next Right Now (NRN) is meant to help you build **production-grade** projects using the **Next.js framework**.

NRN is maintained with several purposes in mind:

*   To be used as a **boilerplate** to quickly deploy a **new** project.
    *   It is used in production by [Unly](http://unly.org/), and thus covers enterprise-grade features and needs.
    *   It has been used to build production-grade websites within 2h time during a French COVID-19 hackathon. (March 2020)
    *   It has been used to build [Unly Solidarity](https://solidarity.unly.org/en), a fully static website meant to help French students find various solutions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.
    *   It has been used to build [NRN Admin](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now-admin) _(Now unmaintained/discontinued)_
*   To be used as an **educational** resource, meant to be used as a **learning/teaching** resource, even if you don't use it as a boilerplate.
*   Provide various [presets](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/blob/gh-pages/concepts/presets), to help you getting started with the preset that matches the closest your needs.
*   To be **flexible** and allow for extensive **customisation**, based on your own needs and use-cases.

Don't hesitate to share your opinion about your ["getting started"](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/issues/14) experience!

Documentation
-------------

[](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now?screenshot=true#documentation)

There are several sources of documentation:

*   [**General documentation**](https://unlyed.github.io/next-right-now/) contains general documentation about the NRN project.
    *   Great to learn about our concepts and get an overview of all features NRN has to offer
*   **Demo documentation**, which is different for each preset and showcases built-in features within that preset.
    *   Great to see code usage examples

Both documentations are related and there are many links from the demos toward the general doc.

Testimonials
------------

[](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now?screenshot=true#testimonials)

> "We initially built our app with Create React App and as our product evolves we needed to have a solid SEO. We planned to migrate to NextJS, but it looked very time-consuming to set up everything again. Here's come Next Right Now providing a complete boilerplate with great tools already integrated like Sentry or Locize. TypeScript, with good typings, is the icing on the cake. It helps us a lot to move quickly on NextJS." - [ApplyFuture](https://www.applyfuture.com/), _2020-10_

> "Edooking is a digital marketplace for the international education industry. It was born in 2019 and we wanted it to be built in a stable and scalable platform, so we decided to use Next.js. After months implementing the MVP we saw that it was going to take a long time to implement all the basic features we needed like i18n, Sentry, Locize and Amplitude, after some research we found Next-Right-Now, a production-grade solution that speeded our development workflow a lot, the work that was going to take months became days. After more than a year using it we're very happy with the decision we made. Maintainers are very responsive and the code is really well written." - [Samuel Silva | Edooking](https://www.edooking.com/), _2021-06_
