This introduces improvements for XBlock interactions within iframes:
* Add default styles for Library Content that renders in the iframe in the new Studio unit page
* When the `isIframeEmbed` option is enabled, the XBlock sends a `postMessage` to the parent window. When sending such a message, the standard link transition is cancelled and the transition is carried out in the MFE.")

[build(eslint): Ignore Symlinks and Reduce Violation Limit (](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/commit/3e9158e9a8467e366fa1d76ca8f13e39150480c9 "build(eslint): Ignore Symlinks and Reduce Violation Limit (#36010)
Background: We have a large number of standing eslint violations in our
legacy frontends. Rather than fixing or amnesty-ing all of them, we've
opted to use a simple integer limit of violations. Exceeding this
limit causes the quality check to fail.
Before we moved eslint off of Paver [1], the limit was unreasonably
high (probably due to deprecations that removed violation-rich frontend
code). This was good, except for the fact that we essentially weren't
catching when new violations creeped into the JS code.
So, in [1], we lowered the limit down to the lowest possible value,
which we thought was 1285. However, we've found that this made the check
flaky-- turned out, we have been unintentionally double-counting various
violations due to the symlinks in edx-platform. Some of those symlinks'
existence is dependent on whether and how `npm ci` and `npm run build`
have been run. As a result, 1285 would pass in some contexts, and fail
in other contexts.
The fix is to simply add all the relevant edx-platform symlinks to
.eslintignore. This allows us to lower the violations limit to 734.

Remove the trailing slashes from the .gitignore entries for static asset
build artifacts. With these slashes, only directory contents are
ignored. Without these slashes, the artifact is ignored whether it is a
directory *or* an actual file (particularly, in our case: a symlink).
This allows us to build edx-platform static assets into a separate
directory, and then symlink to them from edx-platform.
Also: We remove the duplicate cms/static/css/ gitignore entry.")

[Faster "npm install" without progress bar](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/commit/9d00c8798d5c7b9ae7a383a3e1e9183242dff865 "Faster \"npm install\" without progress bar
In older versions of npm, displaying a progress bar considerably slows
down \"npm install\" commands: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/11283
In Ubuntu 16.04 (supported by open edx) the default version of npm is
3.5.2, so it is affected this issue. The progress bar can be deactivated
globally by running \"npm set progress=false\", but this is a little-known
command.
With this change, all edx-platform developers benefit from the speed
increase. On a production server with excellent bandwidth, we made the
following benchmark:
rm -rf ./node_modules ~/.npm && npm set progress=false && time npm
install
real    3m29.980s
user    2m36.152s
sys     0m20.868s
rm -rf ./node_modules ~/.npm && npm set progress=true && time npm
install
real    7m5.580s
user    6m2.824s
sys     0m20.304s
There is thus a ~57% improvement on a task that is typically quite
time-consuming, with minimal inconvenience for developers.")

[feat: ItemBankBlock (](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/commit/08c8e9d214a05e8add6396a70e34d94a87a2fb16 "feat: ItemBankBlock (#35553)
This is a new XBlock that presents a random subset of its children. As of this commit, the block
can only be added as an Advanced component. For Sumac, we plan to enable it as part of the
Libraries Relaunch Beta, under the name \"Problem Bank (Beta)\"
The block does not care if its children are from V1 library, V2 library, or the course itself.
It shares the randomization logic with LegacyLibraryContentBlock. It is also fully backwards-compatible with LegacyLibraryContentBlock. So, once V1 libraries are migrated to V2 libraries (after Teak), we eventually
could point the `library_content` entry point at ItemBankBlock.

The V2 libraries project had a few past iterations which were never
launched. This commit cleans up pieces from those which we don't need
for the real Libraries Relaunch MVP in Sumac:
* Remove ENABLE_LIBRARY_AUTHORING_MICROFRONTEND,
LIBRARY_AUTHORING_FRONTEND_URL, and
REDIRECT_TO_LIBRARY_AUTHORING_MICROFRONTEND, all of which are obsolete
now that library authoring has been merged into
https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-authoring.
More details on the new Content Libraries configuration settings are
here: https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-authoring/issues/1334
* Remove dangling support for syncing V2 (learning core-backed) library
content using the LibraryContentBlock. This code was all based on an
older understanding of V2 Content Libraries, where the libraries were
smaller and versioned as a whole rather then versioned by-item.
Reference to V2 libraries will be done on a per-block basis using
the upstream/downstream system, described here:
https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/blob/master/docs/decisions/0020-upstream-downstream.rst
It's important that we remove this support now so that OLX course
authors don't stuble upon it and use it, which would be buggy and
complicate future migrations.
* Remove the \"mode\" parameter from LibraryContentBlock. The only
supported mode was and is \"random\". We will not be adding any further
modes. Going forward for V2, we will have an ItemBank block for
randomizing items (regardless of source), which can be synthesized
with upstream referenced as described above. Existing
LibraryContentBlocks will be migrated.
* Finally, some renamings:
* LibraryContentBlock -> LegacyLibraryContentBlock
* LibraryToolsService -> LegacyLibraryToolsService
* LibrarySummary -> LegacyLibrarySummary
Module names and the old OLX tag (library_content) are unchanged.

Purpose
-------

[](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform?screenshot=true#purpose)

The [Open edX Platform](https://openedx.org/) is a service-oriented platform for authoring and delivering online learning at any scale. The platform is written in Python and JavaScript and makes extensive use of the Django framework. At the highest level, the platform is composed of a monolith, some independently deployable applications (IDAs), and micro-frontends (MFEs) based on the ReactJS.

This repository hosts the monolith at the center of the Open edX platform. Functionally, the edx-platform repository provides two services:

*   CMS (Content Management Service), which powers Open edX Studio, the platform's learning content authoring environment; and
*   LMS (Learning Management Service), which delivers learning content.

Documentation
-------------

[](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform?screenshot=true#documentation)

Documentation can be found at [https://docs.openedx.org/projects/edx-platform](https://docs.openedx.org/projects/edx-platform).

Getting Started
---------------

[](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform?screenshot=true#getting-started)

### For Production

[](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform?screenshot=true#for-production)

Installing and running an Open edX instance is not simple. We strongly recommend that you use a service provider to run the software for you. They have free trials that make it easy to get started: [https://openedx.org/get-started/](https://openedx.org/get-started/)

However, if you have the time and expertise, then it is is possible to self-manage a production Open edX instance. To help you build, customize, upgrade, and scale your instance, we recommend using [Tutor](https://github.com/overhangio/tutor), the community-supported, Docker-based Open edX distribution.

You can read more about getting up and running with a Tutor deployment at the [Site Ops home on docs.openedx.org](https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/site_ops/index.html).

### For Development

[](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform?screenshot=true#for-development)

Tutor also features a [development mode](https://docs.tutor.edly.io/dev.html) which will also help you modify, test, and extend edx-platform. We recommend this method for all Open edX developers.

### Bare Metal (Advanced)

[](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform?screenshot=true#bare-metal-advanced)

It is also possible to spin up an Open edX platform directly on a Linux host. This method is less common and mostly undocumented. The Open edX community will only be able to provided limited support for it.

Running "bare metal" is only advisable for (a) developers seeking an adventure and (b) experienced system administrators who are willing to take the complexity of Open edX configuration and deployment into their own hands.

#### System Dependencies

*   Node 18

Services:

*   MySQL 8.0
*   Mongo 7.x
*   Memcached

Language Packages:

*   Frontend:
    
    *   `npm clean-install` (production)
    *   `npm clean-install --dev` (development)
*   Backend build:
    
    *   `pip install -r requirements/edx/assets.txt`
*   Backend application:
    
    *   `pip install -r requirements/edx/base.txt` (production)
    *   `pip install -r requirements/edx/dev.txt` (development)
    
    Some Python packages have system dependencies. For example, installing these packages on Debian or Ubuntu will require first running `sudo apt install python3-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev build-essential pkg-config` to satisfy the requirements of the `mysqlclient` Python package.
    

#### Codejail Setup

[](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform?screenshot=true#codejail-setup)

As a part of the baremetal setup, you will need to configure your system to work properly with codejail. See the [codejail installation steps](https://github.com/openedx/codejail?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for more details.

#### Build Steps

[](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform?screenshot=true#build-steps)

Create two MySQL databases and a MySQL user with write permissions to both, and configure Django to use them by updating the `DATABASES` setting.

Then, run migrations:

./manage.py lms migrate
./manage.py lms migrate --database=student\_module\_history
./manage.py cms migrate

Build static assets (for more details, see [building static assets](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/blob/master/docs/references/static-assets.rst)):

npm run build  # or, 'build-dev'

Download locales and collect static assets (can be skipped for development sites):

make pull\_translations
./manage.py lms collectstatic
./manage.py cms collectstatic

Set up CMS SSO (for Development):

./manage.py lms manage\_user studio\_worker example@example.com --unusable-password
# DO NOT DO THIS IN PRODUCTION. It will make your auth insecure.
./manage.py lms create\_dot\_application studio-sso-id studio\_worker \\
    --grant-type authorization-code \\
    --skip-authorization \\
    --redirect-uris 'http://localhost:18010/complete/edx-oauth2/' \\
    --scopes user\_id  \\
    --client-id 'studio-sso-id' \\
    --client-secret 'studio-sso-secret'

Set up CMS SSO (for Production):

*   Create the CMS user and the OAuth application:
    
    ./manage.py lms manage\_user studio\_worker <email@yourcompany.com\> --unusable-password
    ./manage.py lms create\_dot\_application studio-sso-id studio\_worker \\
        --grant-type authorization-code \\
        --skip-authorization \\
        --redirect-uris 'http://localhost:18010/complete/edx-oauth2/' \\
        --scopes user\_id
    
*   Log into Django admin (eg. [http://localhost:18000/admin/oauth2\_provider/application/](http://localhost:18000/admin/oauth2_provider/application/)), click into the application you created above (`studio-sso-id`), and copy its "Client secret".
    
*   In your private LMS\_CFG yaml file or your private Django settings module:
    

> *   Set `SOCIAL_AUTH_EDX_OAUTH2_KEY` to the client ID (`studio-sso-id`).
> *   Set `SOCIAL_AUTH_EDX_OAUTH2_SECRET` to the client secret (which you copied).

#### Run the Platform

[](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform?screenshot=true#run-the-platform)

First, ensure MySQL, Mongo, and Memcached are running.

Start the LMS:

./manage.py lms runserver 18000

Start the CMS:

./manage.py cms runserver 18010

This will give you a mostly-headless Open edX platform. Most frontends have been migrated to "Micro-Frontends (MFEs)" which need to be installed and run separately. At a bare minimum, you will need to run the [Authentication MFE](https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-authn/), [Learner Home MFE](https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-learner-dashboard), and [Learning MFE](https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-learning/) in order meaningfully navigate the UI.

Rather than fixing or amnesty-ing all of them, we've\nopted to use a simple integer limit of violations. Exceeding this\nlimit causes the quality check to fail.\nBefore we moved eslint off of Paver [1], the limit was unreasonably\nhigh (probably due to deprecations that removed violation-rich frontend\ncode). This was good, except for the fact that we essentially weren't\ncatching when new violations creeped into the JS code.\nSo, in [1], we lowered the limit down to the lowest possible value,\nwhich we thought was 1285. However, we've found that this made the check\nflaky-- turned out, we have been unintentionally double-counting various\nviolations due to the symlinks in edx-platform. Some of those symlinks'\nexistence is dependent on whether and how `npm ci` and `npm run build`\nhave been run. As a result, 1285 would pass in some contexts, and fail\nin other contexts.\nThe fix is to simply add all the relevant edx-platform symlinks to\n.eslintignore.

The platform is written in Python and JavaScript and makes extensive use of the Django framework. At the highest level, the platform is composed of a monolith, some independently deployable applications (IDAs), and micro-frontends (MFEs) based on the ReactJS.\n\nThis repository hosts the monolith at the center of the Open edX platform. Functionally, the edx-platform repository provides two services:\n\n*   CMS (Content Management Service), which powers Open edX Studio, the platform's learning content authoring environment; and\n*   LMS (Learning Management Service), which delivers learning content.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n[](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform?screenshot=true#documentation)\n\nDocumentation can be found at [https://docs.openedx.org/projects/edx-platform](https://docs.openedx.org/projects/edx-platform).\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\n[](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform?screenshot=true#getting-started)\n\n### For Production\n\n[](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform?screenshot=true#for-production)\n\nInstalling and running an Open edX instance is not simple. We strongly recommend that you use a service provider to run the software for you. They have free trials that make it easy to get started: [https://openedx.org/get-started/](https://openedx.org/get-started/)\n\nHowever, if you have the time and expertise, then it is is possible to self-manage a production Open edX instance. To help you build, customize, upgrade, and scale your instance, we recommend using [Tutor](https://github.com/overhangio/tutor), the community-supported, Docker-based Open edX distribution.\n\nYou can read more about getting up and running with a Tutor deployment at the [Site Ops home on docs.openedx.org](https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/site_ops/index.html).\n\n### For Development\n\n[](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform?screenshot=true#for-development)\n\nTutor also features a [development mode](https://docs.tutor.edly.io/dev.html) which will also help you modify, test, and extend edx-platform. We recommend this method for all Open edX developers.\n\n### Bare Metal (Advanced)\n\n[](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform?screenshot=true#bare-metal-advanced)\n\nIt is also possible to spin up an Open edX platform directly on a Linux host. This method is less common and mostly undocumented. The Open edX community will only be able to provided limited support for it.\n\nRunning \"bare metal\" is only advisable for (a) developers seeking an adventure and (b) experienced system administrators who are willing to take the complexity of Open edX configuration and deployment into their own hands.\n\n#### System Dependencies\n\n[](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform?screenshot=true#system-dependencies)\n\nOS: \\* Ubuntu 22.04\n\n*   Ubuntu 24.04\n\nInterperters/Tools:\n\n*   Python 3.11\n*   Node 18\n\nServices:\n\n*   MySQL 8.0\n*   Mongo 7.x\n*   Memcached\n\nLanguage Packages:\n\n*   Frontend:\n    \n    *   `npm clean-install` (production)\n    *   `npm clean-install --dev` (development)\n*   Backend build:\n    \n    *   `pip install -r requirements/edx/assets.txt`\n*   Backend application:\n    \n    *   `pip install -r requirements/edx/base.txt` (production)\n    *   `pip install -r requirements/edx/dev.txt` (development)\n    \n    Some Python packages have system dependencies. For example, installing these packages on Debian or Ubuntu will require first running `sudo apt install python3-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev build-essential pkg-config` to satisfy the requirements of the `mysqlclient` Python package.\n    \n\n#### Codejail Setup\n\n[](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform?screenshot=true#codejail-setup)\n\nAs a part of the baremetal setup, you will need to configure your system to work properly with codejail. See the [codejail installation steps](https://github.com/openedx/codejail?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for more details.\n\n#### Build Steps\n\n[](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform?screenshot=true#build-steps)\n\nCreate two MySQL databases and a MySQL user with write permissions to both, and configure Django to use them by updating the `DATABASES` setting.\n\nThen, run migrations:\n\n./manage.py lms migrate\n./manage.py lms migrate --database=student\\_module\\_history\n./manage.py cms migrate\n\nBuild static assets (for more details, see [building static assets](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/blob/master/docs/references/static-assets.rst)):\n\nnpm run build  # or, 'build-dev'\n\nDownload locales and collect static assets (can be skipped for development sites):\n\nmake pull\\_translations\n./manage.py lms collectstatic\n./manage.py cms collectstatic\n\nSet up CMS SSO (for Development):\n\n./manage.py lms manage\\_user studio\\_worker example@example.com --unusable-password\n# DO NOT DO THIS IN PRODUCTION. It will make your auth insecure.\n./manage.py lms create\\_dot\\_application studio-sso-id studio\\_worker \\\\\n    --grant-type authorization-code \\\\\n    --skip-authorization \\\\\n    --redirect-uris 'http://localhost:18010/complete/edx-oauth2/' \\\\\n    --scopes user\\_id  \\\\\n    --client-id 'studio-sso-id' \\\\\n    --client-secret 'studio-sso-secret'\n\nSet up CMS SSO (for Production):\n\n*   Create the CMS user and the OAuth application:\n    \n    ./manage.py lms manage\\_user studio\\_worker <email@yourcompany.com\\> --unusable-password\n    ./manage.py lms create\\_dot\\_application studio-sso-id studio\\_worker \\\\\n        --grant-type authorization-code \\\\\n        --skip-authorization \\\\\n        --redirect-uris 'http://localhost:18010/complete/edx-oauth2/' \\\\\n        --scopes user\\_id\n    \n*   Log into Django admin (eg. [http://localhost:18000/admin/oauth2\\_provider/application/](http://localhost:18000/admin/oauth2_provider/application/)), click into the application you created above (`studio-sso-id`), and copy its \"Client secret\".\n    \n*   In your private LMS\\_CFG yaml file or your private Django settings module:\n    \n\n> *   Set `SOCIAL_AUTH_EDX_OAUTH2_KEY` to the client ID (`studio-sso-id`).\n> *   Set `SOCIAL_AUTH_EDX_OAUTH2_SECRET` to the client secret (which you copied).\n\n#### Run the Platform\n\n[](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform?screenshot=true#run-the-platform)\n\nFirst, ensure MySQL, Mongo, and Memcached are running.\n\nStart the LMS:\n\n./manage.py lms runserver 18000\n\nStart the CMS:\n\n./manage.py cms runserver 18010\n\nThis will give you a mostly-headless Open edX platform. Most frontends have been migrated to \"Micro-Frontends (MFEs)\" which need to be installed and run separately. At a bare minimum, you will need to run the [Authentication MFE](https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-authn/), [Learner Home MFE](https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-learner-dashboard), and [Learning MFE](https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-learning/) in order meaningfully navigate the UI.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n[](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform?screenshot=true#license)\n\nThe code in this repository is licensed under version 3 of the AGPL unless otherwise noted.
