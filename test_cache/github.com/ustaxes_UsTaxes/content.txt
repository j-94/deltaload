* Update to Node 20, and update modules to a newer version
The module update was done by running `npm update -S`. These aren't
necessarily the latest versions, though.
* Update code for changes in node modules
Most of these changes were due to changes in react-hook-form (or it's
typescript types file). Some of the other ones are probably related to
Typescript checking more things (such as whether attributes are defined
and whether arguments could be undefined or not). One of the changes is
to work around an issue in the PDF library thinking the passed-in
argument isn't a valid type.")[#1987](https://github.com/ustaxes/UsTaxes/pull/1987)[)](https://github.com/ustaxes/UsTaxes/commit/c379331a1b086d28f2466ef8fc97667c2b047ff4 "Update to Node LTS 20 (#1987)

[Age and blindness redux (](https://github.com/ustaxes/UsTaxes/commit/464b66ba507348449fc04bc291707568601a79b0 "Age and blindness redux (#1098)
* Add in age and blindness fields to the Person interface
Replaces the `birthYear` property of `QualifyingInfo` interface
with the `dateOfBirth`
* Turn `TaxPayer` into a generic type
Use a `Date` for the `dateOfBirth` property but have version that
uses a `string` for persistent storage
* Remove ajv-formats.
Originally I thought it would be useful for Date types but it was not being used.
* Fix up schema generation schema references
Schema are automatically generated to reference the type names from
typescript. So for our concrete types we're providing to the schema
generator, we just have to match the names correctly.
* Fix default type parameter
* Fix lingering type mismatches
* Fix validation tests
* Fix action date/string validation mismatches
* Add in migration for age and blindness.
- Use the redux-persist example to create a migration config that
enables upgrading the store
- Add in a version number to the persisted object to facilitate
future migrations
- Not quiet working correctly yet at the FSReducer hard codes in the
name of the previous migration so that loading from file also
requires that you refresh the browser
* test out migration pattern based on gist
https://gist.github.com/lafiosca/b7bbb569ae3fe5c1ce110bf71d7ee153
* Remove some code that didn't prove fruitful for doing typed migrations
* Try to make Dependent tests less brittle.
The previous test code would look for specific number of elements
in the page or in the validation errors. This was sensitive to the
number of form elements shown and since we are changing that to add
in the age and blindness status the counts were all wrong.
Instead this replaces with a test to see if the length is greater
than 1.
* Fix unnecessary checks flagged by linter
* Handle any migration types
* Repair merge in renamed / deleted worksheet
* Try to work through test failures in Dependent.test.tsx
Still have two errors.
* Uncomment some code in Dependent.test.tsx to overcome unused variable compiler error
* remove console.debug statement from Dependent.test.tsx
* Fix bug caused by reset of form with {}
* Fix initial undefined selection testing bug
* Work on failing dependent tests, simplify tests
* Fix dob field test
* Fix serialization transforms to handle dates anywhere
* Improve DatePicker to show required error
DatePicker does not have its own properties handling required + blank
UI.
Update tests to include Input is required error for datepicker
* Make the default date of birth be black for the tax payer.
Previous to this the initial date of birth was the current date
which would cause confusion if a user didn't change to their actual
birth date. The initial value was already blank on the Spouse and
Dependents so this only needed to change on the primary tax payer
* Add in standard deduction allowances for age and blindness.
The standard deduction amount increases if you (or your spouse)
are over 65 or are blind. this adds in those additional deduction
amounts as well as updating the calculation for the deduction if
someone else can claim you as a dependent.
* Fix failing test for Schedule A
There was a test that assumed certain amounts for the standard
deduction that no longer hold true with the allowances for age and
blindness.
Refactored that test to be more resilient to these changes.
* Remove unused import from Schedule A test
* Remove unused variable in Schedule A tests causing build to fail

* Update Dockerfile and README.md to use Node 20 instead of Node 16
Signed-off-by: Saikrishna Arcot <saiarcot895@gmail.com>
* Fix cyclical dependency between redux/fs/Load.tsx and redux/fs/index.ts
There is a cyclical dependency between redux/fs/Load.tsx and
redux/fs/index.ts, where one file imports the other. This is because the
`LoadRaw` function in Load.tsx is using the `loadFile` function in
index.ts. The latter function doesn't appear to be used anywhere else
or exported, so just move it into Load.tsx to break the cyclical
dependency.
This was causing the webapp to not load and instead fail with the
following error:
```
Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access '__WEBPACK_DEFAULT_EXPORT__' before initialization

Note on using this project
--------------------------

[](https://github.com/ustaxes/UsTaxes?screenshot=true#note-on-using-this-project)

This project is built by a growing community. If you notice an error in the outputted PDF or any other error, please submit an issue on the Github issues tab. We appreciate your feedback!

User Data
---------

[](https://github.com/ustaxes/UsTaxes?screenshot=true#user-data)

The project is available strictly via client side. Data is persisted to the site's localstorage so _no personal information ever leaves the user's computer._ For those who want extra security, the codebase can also be built as a [desktop application](https://github.com/ustaxes/UsTaxes?screenshot=true#desktop-application).

Contributing
------------

[](https://github.com/ustaxes/UsTaxes?screenshot=true#contributing)

Thank you for taking the time to contribute; let's make tax filing free for everyone! 🎉

To ensure the project is fun for every contributor, please review:

*   [Code of conduct](https://github.com/ustaxes/UsTaxes/blob/master/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
*   [Contributing guide](https://github.com/ustaxes/UsTaxes/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
*   [Project Architecture](https://github.com/ustaxes/UsTaxes/blob/master/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

Get Started
-----------

[](https://github.com/ustaxes/UsTaxes?screenshot=true#get-started)

This application can be run as either a web application or a [standalone desktop application](https://github.com/ustaxes/UsTaxes?screenshot=true#user-content-desktop-application)

### Web application

[](https://github.com/ustaxes/UsTaxes?screenshot=true#web-application)

This project runs on Node 20. To ensure you're on the proper version, we recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

With `nvm` installed, you may select a version 20 node using:

```shell
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

To run,

```shell
npm ci          # install package dependencies
npm run start   # run app
```

Note: To avoid having to set your node versions, we suggest using a tool like [direnv](https://direnv.net/). With the following configuration file as `.envrc` in project root:

```shell
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"

. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
#. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # Optional, nvm bash completion

nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

your environment will be set up every time you enter the project directory.

#### Docker

[](https://github.com/ustaxes/UsTaxes?screenshot=true#docker)

If preferred, a Docker alternative is available:

```shell
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Open a browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

To stop and remove running containers, run `docker-compose down`.

### Desktop application

[](https://github.com/ustaxes/UsTaxes?screenshot=true#desktop-application)

The desktop application is built with [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/). In addition to the above steps, please [follow this reference for setting up your environment for Tauri](https://tauri.studio/en/docs/getting-started/intro/#setting-up-your-environment).

Once your environment is set up for Tauri, run, `npm run desktop`. To avoid a browser window being spawned in addition to the desktop window, just set the BROWSER environment variable as in: `BROWSER=none npm run desktop`.

To build executables, run `npm run desktop-release`.

Getting help
------------

[](https://github.com/ustaxes/UsTaxes?screenshot=true#getting-help)

Please reach out to us on our [discord](https://discord.gg/dAaz472mPz) if you run into any problems, or [file an issue](https://github.com/ustaxes/ustaxes/issues). Thank you for your support!
