Gatsby Theme Waves
==================

[](https://github.com/pomber/gatsby-waves?screenshot=true#gatsby-theme-waves)

### **I'm not maintaining this project anymore, but I'm working on its spiritual successor: [Code Hike](https://github.com/code-hike/codehike)**

[](https://github.com/pomber/gatsby-waves?screenshot=true#im-not-maintaining-this-project-anymore-but-im-working-on-its-spiritual-successor-code-hike)

Bring scrollytelling to your mdx. Animate code, images, charts, maps and more as you scroll.

 [![Image 9: gatsby waves demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1911623/62062600-971a5780-b229-11e9-9c13-cd6a265594d1.gif)](https://waves.pomb.us/blog/post)[![Image 10: gatsby waves demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1911623/62062600-971a5780-b229-11e9-9c13-cd6a265594d1.gif)](https://waves.pomb.us/blog/post)[](https://waves.pomb.us/blog/post)

[See the live demo](https://waves.pomb.us/)

The MDX looks like this:

```md
import { CodeWave } from "gatsby-theme-waves"

<CodeWave>

```py
# some code
```

# Some markdown

```py
# more code
```

More markdown

> and more

```py
# and more
```

- ok
- that's enough

</CodeWave>
```

Installation
------------

[](https://github.com/pomber/gatsby-waves?screenshot=true#installation)

You need a Gatsby site with MDX. For example, this is how you add gatsby-theme-waves to a site that uses [gatsby-theme-blog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-theme-blog):

1.  Install the theme (and `deepmerge` for merging the theme styles)
    
    ```shell
    npm install --save gatsby-theme-waves deepmerge
    ```
    
2.  Add the theme to your `gatsby-config.js` (at the end of the plugin list just in case)
    
    ```js
    module.exports = {
      plugins: [
        "gatsby-theme-blog",
        "gatsby-theme-waves" // <-- add this
      ]
    };
    ```
    
3.  Merge the styles: create or edit `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js`
    
    ```js
    import wavesTheme from "gatsby-theme-waves/src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index";
    import blogTheme from "gatsby-theme-blog/src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index";
    import merge from "deepmerge";
    
    export default merge(blogTheme, wavesTheme);
    ```
    

4.  Import `CodeWave` and use it in any MDX file
    
    ```md
    import { CodeWave } from "gatsby-theme-waves"
    
    <CodeWave>
    
    ```py
    # some code
    ```
    
    # Some markdown
    
    ```py
    # more code
    ```
    
    More markdown
    
    > and more
    
    ```py
    # and more
    ```
    
    - ok
    - that's enough
    
    </CodeWave>
    ```
    

Your set up should look like [this example](https://github.com/pomber/gatsby-theme-waves/tree/master/blog-demo).

### Code Blocks

[](https://github.com/pomber/gatsby-waves?screenshot=true#code-blocks)

By default the lines that changed between two consecutive code blocks will be highlighted. You can change it to highlight the line (and columns) you want:

```md
```js 1:3,6
// highlights line 1,2,3 and 6
```

```js 5[1,3:6],8
// highlights:
// columns 1,3,4,5 and 6 from line 5
// and line 8
```
```

Coming Soon
-----------

[](https://github.com/pomber/gatsby-waves?screenshot=true#coming-soon)

*   Import code from files
*   Better custom code syntax highlighting using theme-ui
*   More waves
*   More docs
