Layout
------

[](https://github.com/swyxio/spark-joy?screenshot=true#layout)

### Stacking and Elevation

[](https://github.com/swyxio/spark-joy?screenshot=true#stacking-and-elevation)

Good idea to have an elevation system in place. Material's is pretty good: [https://material.io/design/environment/elevation.html](https://material.io/design/environment/elevation.html)

| Component | Default elevation values (dp) |
| --- | --- |
| Dialog | 24 |
| Modal bottom sheet Modal side sheet | 16 |
| Navigation drawer | 16 |
| Floating action button (FAB - pressed) | 12 |
| Standard bottom sheet Standard side sheet | 8 |
| Bottom navigation bar | 8 |
| Bottom app bar | 8 |
| Menus and sub menus | 8 |
| Card (when picked up) | 8 |
| Contained button (pressed state) | 8 |
| Floating action button (FAB - resting elevation) Snackbar | 6 |
| Top app bar (scrolled state) | 4 |
| Top app bar (resting elevation) | 0 or 4 |
| Refresh indicator Search bar (scrolled state) | 3 |
| Contained button (resting elevation) | 2 |
| Search bar (resting elevation) | 1 |
| Card (resting elevation) | 1 |
| Switch | 1 |
| Text button | 0 |
| Standard side sheet | 0 |

### 2D Spacing

[](https://github.com/swyxio/spark-joy?screenshot=true#2d-spacing)

More. Spacing. Please.

[Double your whitespace](https://learnui.design/blog/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1.html#rule-3-double-your-whitespace)

### Responsive Layout Breakpoints

[](https://github.com/swyxio/spark-joy?screenshot=true#responsive-layout-breakpoints)

When in doubt, use Material Layout: [https://material.io/design/layout/responsive-layout-grid.html#breakpoints](https://material.io/design/layout/responsive-layout-grid.html#breakpoints)

| Screen size | Margin | Body | Layout columns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Extra-small (phone) |  |  |  |
| 0-599dp | 16dp | Scaling | 4 |
| Small (tablet) |  |  |  |
| 600-904 | 32dp | Scaling | 8 |
| 905-1239 | Scaling | 840dp | 12 |
| Medium (laptop) |  |  |  |
| 1240-1439 | 200dp | Scaling | 12 |
| Large (desktop) |  |  |  |
| 1440+ | Scaling | 1040 | 12 |

*   [https://piccalil.li/tutorial/build-a-responsive-media-browser-with-css/](https://piccalil.li/tutorial/build-a-responsive-media-browser-with-css/)
*   [Tailwind's breakpoints](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/breakpoints) don't come with layout recommendations but here they are:
    *   sm: 640px
    *   md: 768px
    *   lg: 1024px
    *   xl: 1280px
    *   2xl: 1536px

### Layout Bleed

[](https://github.com/swyxio/spark-joy?screenshot=true#layout-bleed)

A nice bleed lets you put emphasis on things selectively.

You want a normal width, a popout width, and a "full bleed" width. Optional for an intermediate one.

This is the best version of bleed implementation [https://ryanmulligan.dev/blog/layout-breakouts/](https://ryanmulligan.dev/blog/layout-breakouts/) (borrows from [https://joshwcomeau.com/css/full-bleed/](https://joshwcomeau.com/css/full-bleed/))

This is adapted to be responsive

<style\>
	/\* https://ryanmulligan.dev/blog/layout-breakouts/ \*/
	.swyxcontent {
		\--gap: clamp(1rem, 6vw, 3rem);
		\--full: minmax(var(\--gap), 1fr);
		\--content: min(65ch, 100% \- var(\--gap) \* 2);
		\--popout: minmax(0, 2rem);
		\--feature: minmax(0, 5rem);

		display: grid;
		grid-template-columns: 
			\[full-start\]
			\[feature-start\]
			\[popout-start\]
			\[content-start\] var(\--content) \[content-end\]
			\[feature-end\]
			\[popout-end\]
			\[feature-end\]
			\[full-end\]
	}

	@media (min-width: 640px) {
		.swyxcontent {
			grid-template-columns:
				\[full-start\] var(\--full)
				\[feature-start\] var(\--feature)
				\[popout-start\] var(\--popout)
				\[content-start\] var(\--content) \[content-end\]
				var(\--popout) \[popout-end\]
				var(\--feature) \[feature-end\]
				var(\--full) \[full-end\];
		}
	}

	:global(.swyxcontent \> \*) {
		grid-column: content;
	}

	article :global(pre) {
		grid-column: feature;
	}
</style\>

Then you can selectively use the `popout`, `feature`, and `full` classes as needed

.content \> \* {
  grid-column: content;
}
.popout {
  grid-column: popout;
}
.feature {
  grid-column: feature;
}
.full {
  grid-column: full;
}

*   Everything [Harry Roberts](https://twitter.com/csswizardry) writes
    
    *   [Google Fonts strategy](https://csswizardry.com/2020/05/the-fastest-google-fonts/)
        
        <!--
           - 1. Preemptively warm up the fonts’ origin.
           -
           - 2. Initiate a high-priority, asynchronous fetch for the CSS file. Works in
           -    most modern browsers.
           -
           - 3. Initiate a low-priority, asynchronous fetch that gets applied to the page
           -    only after it’s arrived. Works in all browsers with JavaScript enabled.
           -
           - 4. In the unlikely event that a visitor has intentionally disabled
           -    JavaScript, fall back to the original method. The good news is that,
           -    although this is a render-blocking request, it can still make use of the
           -    preconnect which makes it marginally faster than the default.

### Line Height

[](https://github.com/swyxio/spark-joy?screenshot=true#line-height)

[https://www.thegoodlineheight.com](https://www.thegoodlineheight.com/)

### Line Width

[](https://github.com/swyxio/spark-joy?screenshot=true#line-width)

Don't forget setting `max-width` - betweeen 60-75chars is good.

*   [https://pearsonified.com/characters-per-line/](https://pearsonified.com/characters-per-line/)
*   [https://grtcalculator.com/](https://grtcalculator.com/)
*   [https://www.charactercountonline.com/](https://www.charactercountonline.com/)
*   [https://charcounter.com/en/](https://charcounter.com/en/)

You may wish to use `max-width: 60ch` on content. [Note on the `ch` unit not being EXACTLY 60 chars](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2018/06/28/what-is-the-css-ch-unit/)

### Kerning and char spacing

[](https://github.com/swyxio/spark-joy?screenshot=true#kerning-and-char-spacing)

Don't forget setting Leading (line height) on your h1 text and minding kerning:[![Image 24: https://hottips.imgix.net/2020/07/044-tracking-animation.gif](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/247501e47b30f6d68c2bd1d75bbf9a43b2fca73b34825abb68b5cecc68ce8c70/68747470733a2f2f686f74746970732e696d6769782e6e65742f323032302f30372f3034342d747261636b696e672d616e696d6174696f6e2e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/247501e47b30f6d68c2bd1d75bbf9a43b2fca73b34825abb68b5cecc68ce8c70/68747470733a2f2f686f74746970732e696d6769782e6e65742f323032302f30372f3034342d747261636b696e672d616e696d6174696f6e2e676966)

*   [https://99designs.com/blog/tips/11-kerning-tips/](https://99designs.com/blog/tips/11-kerning-tips/)

When you use allcaps section titles, set the tracking (`letting-spacing`) a little wider. ([Example from Steve Schoger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6-q5BheEYU))

### Font Sizing

[](https://github.com/swyxio/spark-joy?screenshot=true#font-sizing)

*   DON'T GO CRAZY WITH FONT SIZES. Try to use 1-2 sizes and vary other things like weight, space/leading, color, casing.
*   Don't rely on varying fontsize to control hierarchy - also use font weight (normal = 400/500, heavy = 600/700) and color
    *   Don't go under font weight 400, use a lighter color or smaller fontsize instead
*   Fluid typography with [`clamp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp): `font-size: clamp(1.125rem, 1rem + 2vw, 1.5rem)`
    *   [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/design-v18/) v18: `font-size: clamp(2rem, calc(2rem + 1.2vw), 3rem);`
    *   Another responsive typography fallback - [`font-size: calc(1rem + 2px + ((100vw - 550px) / 250))`](https://twitter.com/Kikobeats/status/1093620157912616966?s=20) - you can [fit text to screen width](https://twitter.com/shshaw/status/1240647643388395521?s=20)

Colors
------

[](https://github.com/swyxio/spark-joy?screenshot=true#colors)

Pick a primary "brand" color to match your personality. [DO NOT OVERUSE IT.](https://twitter.com/steveschoger/status/1299372332579008515)

*   Blue: safe, familiar
*   Gold: expensive, sophisticated ([Examples](https://twitter.com/erikdkennedy/status/948914185596960768), [again](https://twitter.com/erikdkennedy/status/1331236629571362816?s=20))
*   Pink: fun, not so serious

You can also have a grey for secondary content, and lighter grey for tertiary content.

Don't use system default/named colors, too brutal. Soften it a bit. "[Never use black](https://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/)" has been proposed as a rule, but [this is debated](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24303042).

Here's a [more complete primer on color personalities](https://99designs.com/blog/tips/logo-color-meanings/) with more examples.

**Mind accessibility**. 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women have color blindness. Make sure to check that important distinctions can be perceived.

*   [https://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/](https://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/)
*   use the concept of "luminance contrast" [https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1351566026090053632](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1351566026090053632)

Example blueish paletteMonotone:

*   White-ish Card background: #FCFCFC
*   Blueish-Black icons: #1C1E20
*   Lighter text on white: #485963
*   Bluish background: #202D34

Multicolor:

*   Black: #1d1d1d.
*   purple: #b066ff;
*   blue: #203447;
*   lightblue: #1f4662;
*   blue2: #1C2F40;
*   yellow: #ffc600;
*   pink: #EB4471;
*   white: #d7d7d7;

You may or may not want to use generic names if you want it swappable for dark mode:Example [yellowish palette](https://codepen.io/oliviale/full/XyqQYL):

*   primary-light: #FFD151 mustard
*   primary-dark: #FFAE03 UCLA gold
*   secondary-success: #20A39E light sea green
*   secondary-warning: #EF5B5B sunset orange
*   secondary-info: #08D377 dark cerulean
*   grays: #E8E9E9, #D1D3D4, #BABDBF, #808488, #666A6D, #4D5052, #333537, #1C1D1E

Examples: [https://dev.to/dcodeyt/add-dark-mode-to-your-websites-with-css-5bh4](https://dev.to/dcodeyt/add-dark-mode-to-your-websites-with-css-5bh4)

**Note - THIS IS DISPUTED!!!** Even Slack's impl has separate light and dark theming.

> The problem is "primary" isn't a color, it's a measure of contrast in the current context. On the same page you might have a white panel with a black button and a black panel with a white button, and both of those buttons are "primary" even though they are different colors. - [Adam Wathan](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1291724757402976257?s=20)

One liner dark mode (careful about perf!): `filter: invert(100%) hue-rotate(180deg);` - more [filters here](https://svelte.dev/repl/defc901c5f434ed4a76161605cf1db76?version=3.29.0)

### Color Gradients

[](https://github.com/swyxio/spark-joy?screenshot=true#color-gradients)

Note: Default gradients often have "hard edges" that are too rough. ([example](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/status/1401926170589863946), [example](https://twitter.com/finmoorhouse/status/1543580508508065794?s=21&t=PBDS5C7C4FeqBA0wctOaCQ)). [Add a third color stop in the middle and boost saturation](https://twitter.com/erikdkennedy/status/1612867685192466432?s=20). You can use [esaing gradients](https://larsenwork.com/easing-gradients/) in future.

#### Background Gradients

[](https://github.com/swyxio/spark-joy?screenshot=true#background-gradients)

Make sure to see the [Color Gradients](https://github.com/swyxio/spark-joy?screenshot=true#color-gradients) section to generate gradients

background-image: linear-gradient(
  120deg,
  hsl(200 50% 90%) 0%,
  hsl(200 100% 90%) 100%
);

Linear gradients can be "eased" to be smoother: [https://css-tricks.com/easing-linear-gradients/](https://css-tricks.com/easing-linear-gradients/)

    *   Use near-black and near-white instead of pure black and white
    *   Saturate your neutrals
    *   Use high contrast for important elements
    *   Everything in your design should be deliberate
    *   Optical alignment is often better than mathematical alignment
    *   Lower letter spacing and line height with larger text. Raise them with smaller text
    *   Container borders should contrast with both the container and the background
    *   Everything should be aligned with something else
    *   Colours in a palette should have distinct brightness values
    *   If you saturate your neutrals you should use warm or cool colours, not both
    *   Measurements should be mathematically related
    *   Elements should go in order of visual weight
    *   If you use a horizontal grid, use 12 columns
    *   Spacing should go between points of high contrast
    *   Closer elements should be lighter
    *   Make drop shadow blur values double their distance values
    *   Put simple on complex or complex on simple
    *   Keep container colours within brightness limits
    *   Make outer padding the same or more than inner padding
    *   Keep body text at 16px or above
    *   Use a line length around 70 characters
    *   Make horizontal padding twice the vertical padding in buttons
    *   Use two typefaces at most
    *   Nest corners properly
    *   Don’t put two hard divides next to each other

*   3 most common mistakes of UI design by [MDS](https://robhope.com/yo-mds)
    *   too many font sizes used. Try to use 1-2 sizes and vary other things like weight, negative space, color, casing.
    *   don't over rely on strict mathematical spacing - use optical alignment instead - make judgments based on the needs of the layout.
    *   consistent color usage. Tappable = one color. dont make titles and buttons same color. mind accessibility.
*   [Simple Layout checklist](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0gPtgNVonXPT1NsWGpKZWZKV1U/edit)
    *   Clear idea of purpose, target audience, where/how long it will be seen
    *   Information hierarchy (vary size, contrast, position)
    *   Clear visual structure - pick the most suitable way to group elements
    *   Space - leave enough whitespace. Too much \> too little
    *   Alignment - use as few lines as possible

*   Matt D Smith Checklist ([Notion](https://www.notion.so/UI-Checklist-d47ae9676a004a9b9d942a7908ac9efd))
    *   Do I have a very solid understanding of the _human_ problem I'm solving with this interface?
    *   Is this a low, medium, or high complexity project and have I let that drive my decision for designing a low-fidelity version or not?
    *   If I'm using reference material, would I feel comfortable putting my design next to the reference and talking through the areas I used for inspiration, without giving the impression that I copied or created a very close derivative?
    *   Have I had the necessary conversations with stakeholders and/or developers about the goal of this project and its ability to be implemented. In other words, am I aware of business and/or technological constraints?
    *   Typography
        *   Have I chosen font sizes very deliberately (_ideally 2-4 per screen or section)_ and pushed myself to use as few as possible?
        *   Am I sure there's not a single straggling font size lying around somewhere that could be matched up with another size?
        *   Are there any areas where font **weight** would be a better change instead of font size?
        *   Are there any areas where font case—whether UPPERCASE, Title Case, or Sentence case—would be more affective that a font size change?
        *   Does the visual hierarchy of my typography content match my intentions with what is the most important on the screen?
        *   Do my titles and body copy _feel_ right together? Am I playing with type scale in a fun and dynamic way?
        *   Have I defined the usage of certain sizes and/or colors for my typography, whether in my own head or specifically written documentation?
        *   Are my typographic color choices extrememly well defined, a specific color for links, actions, buttons versus read-only text, and is there anywhere that can be improved?
        *   If applicable, are there any areas where I could add more visual interest to my typography by adding any decorative or informational elements in the surrouding area?
        *   Have I intentionally chosen a specific typeface for specific reasons?
        *   If I haven't used sytem or open source fonts (SF Pro, Roboto, Inter, Helvetica, etc.) have I done due dilligence on purchasing the appropriate font licensing and/or checked with stakeholders or developers if the font I've chosen is approved and/or can be used during development?
        *   Does the typeface I've chosen convey the right personality or feeling that I want to convey?
        *   Have I considered adding the ability for a user to choose their own type size based on their preference, and if not have a made sure that the most important content is no smaller than 16px?
    *   Layout
        *   Have I used the box model concept while laying out out every element of my designs, or are there a few stragglers here and there that I haven't been intentional about?
        *   Have I used a clear grid structure with properly aligned elements that visually balance each other out? (12 column, etc.)
        *   Have I used an intentional implicit grid for all of the negative space surrounding the elements in my layout, especially to define intentional relationships with my content?
        *   Does my design have enough negative space?
        *   Are there elements in my design where the negative space could double to create a much nicer layout?
        *   Does anything feel too crammed or too tight and have I considered layering the information where necessary to create more simplicity?
        *   Is all of the text left or right aligned and scannable where applicable?
        *   Does my eye have to dart around all over the screen to view the content or is there a nice line of continuation I can pay attention to while viewing?
        *   Are my interface elements balanced compositionally with layout anchors?
        *   Are there any areas where my designs have been mathematically aligned, but still feel off? Have I correct these with optical alignment?
        *   Is the density of my design appropriate? Is it tight and condensed because of the high volume of information? Is it a medium density? Are there ways to add more negative space to have a more open and friendly feel with a lower density layout?
        *   Are there any areas where I could create more intentional prioritization of content by using scale or visual weight with background color changes, etc.?
        *   Is there appropriate affordance given to the interactive objects on the screen? Is it easy to see what's scrollable, swipeable, tappable, etc.? Are there areas where I know that it could be made more clear?
        *   Have I fully considered exandable/collapseable or other interactive options for some of the components? Does everything on the screen need to be on the screen or is there a more elegant solution for the content that involves adding another page or another section?
    *   Color
        *   Have a made a conscious choice between using HEX codes, RGB values, or HSB/HSL section methods?
        *   Have I double checked to make sure that all of my interface elements have appropriate color contrast and meet at least WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards?
        *   Have I made a very conscious decision about my structural colors versus my interactive colors?
        *   Have I clearly defined a primary, secondary, and possibly tertiary CTA (call to action) color and used it accordingly?
        *   Could my secondary styles and colors be tweaked slightly to better compliment the primary CTA?
        *   Have I very strategically defined all of my color usages to create an understandable framework for future color usage? Is there room for improvement?
        *   Does my color palette follow a systematic and intentional method for color selection based on a base HUE?
        *   Is there room to provide a secondary HUE for structural or interactive colors or is the one I've chosen adequate?
        *   Is there any opportunity for using a well-placed gradient? If I'm using a gradient have I double checked that any text used in combination with it is accessible?
        *   Have I specifically chosen a very strict set of greys, if applicable, for my entire project across every screen?
        *   Are there any greys that are very close in color that could be combined and simplified?
        *   Have I revised and/or adjusted my overall color palette to include all colors and usages of those colors for every single element?
        *   Have I considered the Z-axis of my layout and how white, grey, and darker colors create a natural depth? Are the objects closest to my foreground the lightest in color?
        *   If my UI is dark in color, have I been extremely conscious with the overall contrast and meticulously chosen each color?
        *   If my UI is dark in color, have I reserved absolute white and absolute black for specific pieces of the interface? Is there any room for almost black or almost white, with subtle changes in color?
    *   Style
        *   Have I consciously decided on a specific design direction?
        *   Can I intentionally describe my designs with specific adjectives?
        *   Have I considered the constraints of the medium I'm designing for and how that should and will affect my designs?
        *   Have I very consciously chosen specific corner radius styles? Should they be hard edge, slightly rounded, very rounded, pill-shaped?
        *   If I have chosen specific corner radius styles for modules, buttons, etc. have I explored other options to see if there are better alternatives that specifically map to the type of style I'm trying to achieve?
        *   Have I very specifically chosen a certain type of border or divider for my content?
        *   Have I considered using only negative space to create a separation of content rather than relying on a line or separate modules?
        *   Have I made sure my borders or dividers don't overpower the actual content? Could they be toned down to shift focus on the most important areas of the designs?
        *   Have I considered depth, lighting, and shadow to the best of its potential? If I'm using any type of depth as a metaphor, are my darkest elements going back into the design and my brightest elements coming forward intentionally?
        *   Have I strongly considered how my buttons are interacted with? Hover states, tapped states, etc. Are there any fun animations that I could add to double-down on the direction I'm trying to achieve?
        *   Are my buttons working as hard as they should be to create laser-like focus on the most important actions on the screen when applicable?
    *   Imagery
        *   Knowing that great imagery will make my designs 10X better than subpar imagery, have I intentionally chosen, selected, sourced, or created the absolute best possible imagery for my designs (if applicable)?
        *   Does the imagery I'm using make my designs better or is it distracting?
        *   Am I intentionally using a static image in my designs that will never be changed, or is there an opportunity to create something more dynamic based on events or user action?
        *   Are there places in my design where I can leverage emoji (like on these checklist titles) to create a more unique design?
        *   Am I using a rasterized bitmap image when I could be using CSS or an SVG in place of it?
        *   If I'm using dynamic imagery in my designs, have I stress tested for all black or all white images to make sure the design still works?
        *   If my designs contain user-generated content, have I carefully considered empty states, the ability to change the imagery, the ability to create and/or upload the imagery?
        *   Are there smart defaults that look nice when no user generate content has been added?
        *   Am I using any imagery that is only "so-so" and not adding great value to the design?
        *   Have I paid special attention to any icons used in my project?
        *   Are my icons following a strong pattern of size, color, stroke, fill, etc.?
        *   Are my icons decorating or interactive and have I made that extremely clear with the designs?
        *   Are there any opportunities to create a simple custom illustration (line, shape, pattern, etc.) to add more visual interest to the design?
        *   Have I considered how the products marketing site or branding should or will impact the interface?
        *   Is there an app store icon that needs to be designed? Are there opportunies to create a fun branded experience between the app icon, the loading screen, and the default view of the first time a user launches the app?
        *   If I'm designing a website have I designed a custom favicon that shows up in the browser tab as an extra little detail for my project?
    *   Elements
        *   Does my project have a clear navigation structure and ideally prioritize the top 5 or fewer links or sections?
        *   Have I strongly considered how my input fields function (default, hover, focused, disabled, error, etc.) and created a very clear state design for all possibilities?
        *   Do my input fields match the overall style and direction of the project?
        *   Are the forms I've designed absolutey necessary and require the most critical information?
        *   Have I very clearly communicated the reasons for requiring certain information?
        *   If applicable, have I made it clear that certain pieces of information are required for the progress of the user through the app or site?
        *   Have I considered all the variables and/or error states if some information is not gathered properly?
        *   If my project has user profiles, have I considered what it will look like the first time it's used, after information has been added? Are the mechanisms for editing information abundantly clear or is there room for improvement?
        *   Have I carefully considered the implications of a settings screen?
        *   Have I done the hardwork of creating smart defaults for the user and not used the settings screen as a dumping ground for all possible changes?
        *   Have I carefully chosen lists and/or card-based layouts in my designs based on the volume of information?
        *   Are the any missing components to my designs that might not be needed now, but could be very useful in the future, eg. table designs, etc.?
        *   Have I considered the states and function of all of my components and created a well-organized file system?
        *   Is there a need to turn my clean and organized file-system into an actual design system to be used for other projects?
        *   Are there more people on my team (stakeholders, developers, etc.) who need visibility into the choices I'm making for naming components, etc. and should they have an opinion or a say into what things are called as well?
    *   Tactics
        *   Have I explored LOTS of alternative versions of what I'm trying to design and by process of elimination decided on what works best?
        *   If my project is slightly more complex than the average project, whether because of features or team size, have I spent enough time getting everyone on board with how the app should function by using low-fidelity designs?
        *   If my project is a web-based project, have I fully considered the mobile version and used that as a way to force prioritization of features and layout?
        *   If my project is an application, have a used a mobile-first approach to create simplicity up front?
        *   If my project is more of a marketing site, have I designed and explored really nice and impactful desktop versions before confining myself too much with mobile versions?
        *   If my project is an iOS app, have I made intentional decisions about where to follow the Apple HIG (human interface guidelines) or where to deviate from it? If I've deviated, do I have a VERY good reason to do so and are the stakeholders and developers OK with this?
        *   If my project is an Android app, have I made the decision to exclusively use a material design system, or do I have strong reasons for not doing that?
        *   Have I used very intentional placeholder copy and/or images in my designs that could support specific users, etc.?
        *   Have I told a story with my designs (based on features) and could I effectively present my designs using what I've created?
        *   Are my designs organized in a clear way to showcase specific features and flows?
        *   Have I created the necessary prototypes to experiment with animations and interactions?
        *   Do I need to create any separate prototype flows to describe certain functionality to stakeholders or developers?
        *   Have a been an excellent communicator from the very beginning of the project and now that's it's time to hand off the design, I already know what my developer needs?

In other words, am I aware of business and/or technological constraints?\n    *   Typography\n        *   Have I chosen font sizes very deliberately (_ideally 2-4 per screen or section)_ and pushed myself to use as few as possible?\n        *   Am I sure there's not a single straggling font size lying around somewhere that could be matched up with another size?\n        *   Are there any areas where font **weight** would be a better change instead of font size?\n        *   Are there any areas where font case—whether UPPERCASE, Title Case, or Sentence case—would be more affective that a font size change?\n        *   Does the visual hierarchy of my typography content match my intentions with what is the most important on the screen?\n        *   Do my titles and body copy _feel_ right together? Am I playing with type scale in a fun and dynamic way?\n        *   Have I defined the usage of certain sizes and/or colors for my typography, whether in my own head or specifically written documentation?\n        *   Are my typographic color choices extrememly well defined, a specific color for links, actions, buttons versus read-only text, and is there anywhere that can be improved?\n        *   If applicable, are there any areas where I could add more visual interest to my typography by adding any decorative or informational elements in the surrouding area?\n        *   Have I intentionally chosen a specific typeface for specific reasons?\n        *   If I haven't used sytem or open source fonts (SF Pro, Roboto, Inter, Helvetica, etc.) have I done due dilligence on purchasing the appropriate font licensing and/or checked with stakeholders or developers if the font I've chosen is approved and/or can be used during development?\n        *   Does the typeface I've chosen convey the right personality or feeling that I want to convey?\n        *   Have I considered adding the ability for a user to choose their own type size based on their preference, and if not have a made sure that the most important content is no smaller than 16px?\n    *   Layout\n        *   Have I used the box model concept while laying out out every element of my designs, or are there a few stragglers here and there that I haven't been intentional about?\n        *   Have I used a clear grid structure with properly aligned elements that visually balance each other out?

Have I correct these with optical alignment?\n        *   Is the density of my design appropriate? Is it tight and condensed because of the high volume of information? Is it a medium density? Are there ways to add more negative space to have a more open and friendly feel with a lower density layout?\n        *   Are there any areas where I could create more intentional prioritization of content by using scale or visual weight with background color changes, etc.?\n        *   Is there appropriate affordance given to the interactive objects on the screen? Is it easy to see what's scrollable, swipeable, tappable, etc.? Are there areas where I know that it could be made more clear?\n        *   Have I fully considered exandable/collapseable or other interactive options for some of the components? Does everything on the screen need to be on the screen or is there a more elegant solution for the content that involves adding another page or another section?\n    *   Color\n        *   Have a made a conscious choice between using HEX codes, RGB values, or HSB/HSL section methods?\n        *   Have I double checked to make sure that all of my interface elements have appropriate color contrast and meet at least WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards?\n        *   Have I made a very conscious decision about my structural colors versus my interactive colors?\n        *   Have I clearly defined a primary, secondary, and possibly tertiary CTA (call to action) color and used it accordingly?\n        *   Could my secondary styles and colors be tweaked slightly to better compliment the primary CTA?\n        *   Have I very strategically defined all of my color usages to create an understandable framework for future color usage? Is there room for improvement?\n        *   Does my color palette follow a systematic and intentional method for color selection based on a base HUE?\n        *   Is there room to provide a secondary HUE for structural or interactive colors or is the one I've chosen adequate?\n        *   Is there any opportunity for using a well-placed gradient?

Are the objects closest to my foreground the lightest in color?\n        *   If my UI is dark in color, have I been extremely conscious with the overall contrast and meticulously chosen each color?\n        *   If my UI is dark in color, have I reserved absolute white and absolute black for specific pieces of the interface?

Should they be hard edge, slightly rounded, very rounded, pill-shaped?\n        *   If I have chosen specific corner radius styles for modules, buttons, etc. have I explored other options to see if there are better alternatives that specifically map to the type of style I'm trying to achieve?\n        *   Have I very specifically chosen a certain type of border or divider for my content?\n        *   Have I considered using only negative space to create a separation of content rather than relying on a line or separate modules?\n        *   Have I made sure my borders or dividers don't overpower the actual content? Could they be toned down to shift focus on the most important areas of the designs?\n        *   Have I considered depth, lighting, and shadow to the best of its potential? If I'm using any type of depth as a metaphor, are my darkest elements going back into the design and my brightest elements coming forward intentionally?\n        *   Have I strongly considered how my buttons are interacted with? Hover states, tapped states, etc. Are there any fun animations that I could add to double-down on the direction I'm trying to achieve?\n        *   Are my buttons working as hard as they should be to create laser-like focus on the most important actions on the screen when applicable?\n    *   Imagery\n        *   Knowing that great imagery will make my designs 10X better than subpar imagery, have I intentionally chosen, selected, sourced, or created the absolute best possible imagery for my designs (if applicable)?\n        *   Does the imagery I'm using make my designs better or is it distracting?\n        *   Am I intentionally using a static image in my designs that will never be changed, or is there an opportunity to create something more dynamic based on events or user action?\n        *   Are there places in my design where I can leverage emoji (like on these checklist titles) to create a more unique design?\n        *   Am I using a rasterized bitmap image when I could be using CSS or an SVG in place of it?\n        *   If I'm using dynamic imagery in my designs, have I stress tested for all black or all white images to make sure the design still works?\n        *   If my designs contain user-generated content, have I carefully considered empty states, the ability to change the imagery, the ability to create and/or upload the imagery?\n        *   Are there smart defaults that look nice when no user generate content has been added?\n        *   Am I using any imagery that is only \"so-so\" and not adding great value to the design?\n        *   Have I paid special attention to any icons used in my project?\n        *   Are my icons following a strong pattern of size, color, stroke, fill, etc.?\n        *   Are my icons decorating or interactive and have I made that extremely clear with the designs?\n        *   Are there any opportunities to create a simple custom illustration (line, shape, pattern, etc.) to add more visual interest to the design?\n        *   Have I considered how the products marketing site or branding should or will impact the interface?\n        *   Is there an app store icon that needs to be designed? Are there opportunies to create a fun branded experience between the app icon, the loading screen, and the default view of the first time a user launches the app?\n        *   If I'm designing a website have I designed a custom favicon that shows up in the browser tab as an extra little detail for my project?\n    *   Elements\n        *   Does my project have a clear navigation structure and ideally prioritize the top 5 or fewer links or sections?\n        *   Have I strongly considered how my input fields function (default, hover, focused, disabled, error, etc.) and created a very clear state design for all possibilities?\n        *   Do my input fields match the overall style and direction of the project?\n        *   Are the forms I've designed absolutey necessary and require the most critical information?\n        *   Have I very clearly communicated the reasons for requiring certain information?\n        *   If applicable, have I made it clear that certain pieces of information are required for the progress of the user through the app or site?\n        *   Have I considered all the variables and/or error states if some information is not gathered properly?\n        *   If my project has user profiles, have I considered what it will look like the first time it's used, after information has been added? Are the mechanisms for editing information abundantly clear or is there room for improvement?\n        *   Have I carefully considered the implications of a settings screen?\n        *   Have I done the hardwork of creating smart defaults for the user and not used the settings screen as a dumping ground for all possible changes?\n        *   Have I carefully chosen lists and/or card-based layouts in my designs based on the volume of information?\n        *   Are the any missing components to my designs that might not be needed now, but could be very useful in the future, eg. table designs, etc.?\n        *   Have I considered the states and function of all of my components and created a well-organized file system?\n        *   Is there a need to turn my clean and organized file-system into an actual design system to be used for other projects?\n        *   Are there more people on my team (stakeholders, developers, etc.) who need visibility into the choices I'm making for naming components, etc. and should they have an opinion or a say into what things are called as well?\n    *   Tactics\n        *   Have I explored LOTS of alternative versions of what I'm trying to design and by process of elimination decided on what works best?\n        *   If my project is slightly more complex than the average project, whether because of features or team size, have I spent enough time getting everyone on board with how the app should function by using low-fidelity designs?\n        *   If my project is a web-based project, have I fully considered the mobile version and used that as a way to force prioritization of features and layout?\n        *   If my project is an application, have a used a mobile-first approach to create simplicity up front?\n        *   If my project is more of a marketing site, have I designed and explored really nice and impactful desktop versions before confining myself too much with mobile versions?\n        *   If my project is an iOS app, have I made intentional decisions about where to follow the Apple HIG (human interface guidelines) or where to deviate from it? If I've deviated, do I have a VERY good reason to do so and are the stakeholders and developers OK with this?\n        *   If my project is an Android app, have I made the decision to exclusively use a material design system, or do I have strong reasons for not doing that?\n        *   Have I used very intentional placeholder copy and/or images in my designs that could support specific users, etc.?\n        *   Have I told a story with my designs (based on features) and could I effectively present my designs using what I've created?\n        *   Are my designs organized in a clear way to showcase specific features and flows?\n        *   Have I created the necessary prototypes to experiment with animations and interactions?\n        *   Do I need to create any separate prototype flows to describe certain functionality to stakeholders or developers?\n        *   Have a been an excellent communicator from the very beginning of the project and now that's it's time to hand off the design, I already know what my developer needs?\n*   [UI Common Mistakes Checklist](https://twitter.com/vponamariov/status/1421014957110579203)\n    1.
