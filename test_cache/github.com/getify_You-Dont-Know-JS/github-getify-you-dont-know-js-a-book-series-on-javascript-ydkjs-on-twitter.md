With over 150 courses on all things frontend, this should be your first and only stop for quality video training on HTML, CSS, JS, and related technologies.\n\n**Note:** I teach [all my workshops](https://frontendmasters.com/kyle-simpson) exclusively through Frontend Masters. If you like this book content, please check out my video training courses.\n\nI want to extend a warm and deep thanks to Marc Grabanski and the entire Frontend Masters team, not only for their excellent work with the video training platform, but for their unwavering support of me and of the \"You Don't Know JS\" books!\n\n* * *\n\nLicense & Copyright\n-------------------\n\n[](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS?screenshot=true#license--copyright)\n\nThe materials herein are all Â© 2019-2022 Kyle Simpson.\n\n[![Image 29: Creative Commons License](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9f7bc562681fbb1040b1f38804ec5d78eceb8369a45002d0f00d45c60ec4382e/68747470733a2f2f692e6372656174697665636f6d6d6f6e732e6f72672f6c2f62792d6e632d6e642f342e302f38387833312e706e67)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)  \nThis work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).\n\nAbout\n-----\n\nA book series on JavaScript.
