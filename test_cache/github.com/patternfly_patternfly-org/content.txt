A Node version 22 or greater is also required.

### Live Reload Server

#### New server

[](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org?screenshot=true#new-server)

You can install the NPM dependencies with:

```
yarn install
```

A local development server at [http://localhost:8003](http://localhost:8003/) can be started with:

```
yarn start
```

### Build

[](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org?screenshot=true#build)

The site can be built with:

```
yarn build
```

The static assets get copied to build/patternfly-org.

### Deploy

[](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org?screenshot=true#deploy)

When you submit a PR, previews should be automatically generated for you and uploaded as PR comments. This takes between 5-10 minutes.

When the PR is merged to main, the site is first deployed to a [staging S3 bucket.](https://staging.patternfly.org/)

When PatternFly does a release (currently every 3 weeks) this bucket is copied to [https://patternfly.org](https://patternfly.org/).

### Update screenshots

[](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org?screenshot=true#update-screenshots)

To update the screenshots (these are the images that you click on to see a full-page demo):

*   open a terminal and run `yarn build && yarn serve`
*   in another terminal, run `yarn screenshots`

Make sure that the version of Chromium you are using is relatively recent. Version 112.0.5614.0 (Developer Build), for example, isn't compatible with the latest versions of PatternFly, and your screenshots will be off.

Browse the screenshots to make sure that nothing seems super off. You can compare to [PatternFly React staging](https://patternfly-react.surge.sh/) and [PatternFly Core staging](https://pf.patternfly.org/) to verify. You may need to bump PatternFly-React and Core versions if things are only off in the patternfly-org workspace.

### Old submodules

[](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org?screenshot=true#old-submodules)

You might have a dirty file tree with old submodules and folders lying around. You can remove these with:

```
git clean -dfx
```
