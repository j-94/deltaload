[\[FIX\] stock: reset final\_barcode template variable](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/c00167a1cf83083971bbe12a7069a4bd0ea62ba0 "[FIX] stock: reset final_barcode template variable
**Problem**:
When `lot['lot_record'].product_id.valid_ean` is `False`, the `final_barcode` variable retains the value from the previous iteration. This leads to incorrect concatenation with the current `lot['name']` when `lot['lot_record'].product_id.tracking == 'lot'`.
**Solution**:
Reset the `final_barcode` variable at the start of each iteration.
**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Go to Inventory > Settings and enable \"Print GS1 Barcodes for Lots & Serial Numbers\".
2. Navigate to Inventory > Products > Lots/Serial Numbers.
3. Select all records and click Print > Lot/Serial Number (ZPL).
4. Observe that some barcodes incorrectly include the previous barcode as a prefix.

[\[FIX\] packaging: fix lxml.html.clean split](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/59709ca9b445bb293796c46d0076380ec9fba208 "[FIX] packaging: fix lxml.html.clean split
Since lxml.html.clean was moved to a separate package starting in lxml
5.2 the odoo Debian package was broken in Ubuntu 24.04.
A first fix was attempted in 318df32585b. While the package was properly
built with this fix and was installable, but Odoo failed to start under
Ubuntu. The bug flew under the radar because the simple test after the
package build is done with a Docker based on Debian Bookworm.
In fact, the fix was not taken into account because the python packages
defined in the debian/control are not really taken into account by
dh_python3 that tries to compute the python dependencies.
With this commit, a py3dist-overrides file is used to overrides the
package mapping between python packages and debian packages. The same
pipe trick is used as in the previous fix to ensure that the package is
installable in Ubuntu 24.04 (which provides python3-lxml-html) and in
Debian Bookworm (which does not provide the python3-lxm-html).
Finally, the Docker image used for the build and the test is changed to
use Ubuntu 24.04.

[\[FIX\] packaging: include all odoo files in src build](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/11db495938c4263b74089dbcd9ddff7b58533c2d "[FIX] packaging: include all odoo files in src build
Since this old commit 735924878f8, the files that are packaged are
chosen by a list of allowed extensions. This list have to be maintained
each time that a developer adds a new kind of file in a module. This is
error prone [0] as most developer are not aware of that and it's difficult
to monitor.
Moreover, there is no reason to have a different list of installed files
when one install from the git repo instead of the source package.
With this commit, all [1] odoo sources files are included in the source
packaging and the only thing to maintain is a small black-list of file
extensions like for Python bytecode files and for version control files.
[0] see commit d33c05b62a9c6 that fix `.json` missing files.

[\[FIX\] namespace packages: move from pkg\_resources-style to pkg\_util](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/8bf06adc8d78c1bff8dc80ce53d6646e3ad22fff "[FIX] namespace packages: move from pkg_resources-style to pkg_util
Deprecates the previous pkg_resources-style packages. Our use was
not entirely spec compliant, and it broke with setuptools 31.
More information in https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/15718
Instead, use the pkgutil-style namespace packages.
This is spec compliant as long as all other distributions providing
odoo.addons use PEP 420 namespace packages (i.e. no __init__.py).
So this mechanism fully works on Python 3 only, but does not break
anything on Python 2.

\"complex\" external dependency (with version or markers)
Also solve an issue with google auth adding a filter warning
On google-auth import, setuptools will emit a warning in ubuntu noble
when importing pkg_resources.
This was not visible before the previous commits because another import
of pkg_resources was made before enabling the warnings.
The pkg_resources import is removed in google-auth >= 1.23.0 but
the noble version is 1.5.1 (as it was in jammy)
closes odoo/odoo#181768
