Development on this library has slowed down, in favor of working on TensorTrade - a framework for trading with RL: [https://github.com/notadamking/tensortrade](https://github.com/notadamking/tensortrade)

Getting Started
---------------

[](https://github.com/notadamking/RLTrader?screenshot=true#getting-started)

### How to find out if you have nVIDIA GPU?

[](https://github.com/notadamking/RLTrader?screenshot=true#how-to-find-out-if-you-have-nvidia-gpu)

Linux:

sudo lspci | grep -i --color 'vga\\|3d\\|2d' | grep -i nvidia

If this returns anything, then you should have an nVIDIA card.

### Basic usage

[](https://github.com/notadamking/RLTrader?screenshot=true#basic-usage)

The first thing you will need to do to get started is install the requirements. If your system has an nVIDIA GPU that you should start by using:

cd "path-of-your-cloned-rl-trader-dir"
pip install -r requirements.txt

More information regarding how you can take advantage of your GPU while using docker: [https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)

If you have another type of GPU or you simply want to use your CPU, use:

pip install -r requirements.no-gpu.txt

Update your current static files, that are used by default:

 python ./cli.py update-static-data

Afterwards you can simply see the currently available options:

or simply run the project with default options:

If you have a standard set of configs you want to run the trader against, you can specify a config file to load configuration from. Rename config/config.ini.dist to config/config.ini and run

python ./cli.py --from-config config/config.ini optimize

### Testing with vagrant

[](https://github.com/notadamking/RLTrader?screenshot=true#testing-with-vagrant)

Start the vagrant box using:

Code will be located at /vagrant. Play and/or test with whatever package you wish. Note: With vagrant you cannot take full advantage of your GPU, so is mainly for testing purposes

### Testing with docker

[](https://github.com/notadamking/RLTrader?screenshot=true#testing-with-docker)

If you want to run everything within a docker container, then just use:

./run-with-docker (cpu|gpu) (yes|no) optimize

*   cpu - start the container using CPU requirements
*   gpu - start the container using GPU requirements
*   yes | no - start or not a local postgres container Note: in case using yes as second argument, use

python ./ cli.py --params-db-path "postgres://rl\_trader:rl\_trader@localhost" optimize

The database and it's data are pesisted under `data/postgres` locally.

If you want to spin a docker test environment:

./run-with-docker (cpu|gpu) (yes|no)

If you want to run existing tests, then just use:

Fire up a local docker dev environment
--------------------------------------

[](https://github.com/notadamking/RLTrader?screenshot=true#fire-up-a-local-docker-dev-environment)

Windows 10 installation, no CUDA installation needed
----------------------------------------------------

[](https://github.com/notadamking/RLTrader?screenshot=true#windows-10-installation-no-cuda-installation-needed)

conda create --name rltrader python=3.6.8 pip git conda activate rltrader conda install tensorflow-gpu git clone [https://github.com/notadamking/RLTrader](https://github.com/notadamking/RLTrader) pip install -r RLTrader/requirements.txt

Optimizing, Training, and Testing
---------------------------------

[](https://github.com/notadamking/RLTrader?screenshot=true#optimizing-training-and-testing)

While you could just let the agent train and run with the default PPO2 hyper-parameters, your agent would likely not be very profitable. The `stable-baselines` library provides a great set of default parameters that work for most problem domains, but we need to better.

To do this, you will need to run `optimize.py`.

This can take a while (hours to days depending on your hardware setup), but over time it will print to the console as trials are completed. Once a trial is completed, it will be stored in `./data/params.db`, an SQLite database, from which we can pull hyper-parameters to train our agent.

From there, agents will be trained using the best set of hyper-parameters, and later tested on completely new data to verify the generalization of the algorithm.

Feel free to ask any questions in the Discord!

Google Colab
------------

[](https://github.com/notadamking/RLTrader?screenshot=true#google-colab)

Enter and run the following snippet in the first cell to load RLTrader into a Google Colab environment. Don't forget to set hardware acceleration to GPU to speed up training!

```
!git init && git remote add origin https://github.com/notadamking/RLTrader.git && git pull origin master
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Common troubleshooting
----------------------

[](https://github.com/notadamking/RLTrader?screenshot=true#common-troubleshooting)

##### The specified module could not be found.

[](https://github.com/notadamking/RLTrader?screenshot=true#the-specified-module-could-not-be-found)

Normally this is caused by missing mpi module. You should install it according to your platorm.
