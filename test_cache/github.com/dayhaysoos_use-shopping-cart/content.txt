Frequently Asked Questions

This is a list of questions that you might have about use-shopping-cart once you get started.

Why am I getting an error about formatToParts not being a function on older browsers?

You need to polyfill formatToParts if you want to support older browsers. You can find more info on manually polyfilling formatToParts in issue #158.

Why am I getting an SSR error about text content not matching?

It is likely that you are using a value like cartCount that is loaded from LocalStorage which doesn't exist on the server. More info in issue #122
