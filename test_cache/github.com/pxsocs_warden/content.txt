Yes!](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e37f7429b2afa6b69318ad278d15eec19a7ce4dbcbc830c7cb13f80cf79f95a8/68747470733a2f2f62616467656e2e6e65742f62616467652f4f70656e253230536f757263652532302533462f5965732532312f626c75653f69636f6e3d676974687562)](https://github.com/pxsocs/warden/releases/) [![Image 13: Powered by NGU](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ddc359dc14cdfdc547875726639e8c494d22527872fa0cbc2e0d1a89d2c3a7ba/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f506f776572656425323062792d4e4755253230546563686e6f6c6f67792d6f72616e67652e737667)](https://bitcoin.org/)

### Requirements:

[](https://github.com/pxsocs/warden?screenshot=true#requirements)

> 🐍 Python 3.7 or later

This app was built with a couple of goals:

*   Easily track portfolio values;
    
*   Runs analytics on portfolio, including performance, cost basis and others;
    
*   Allows user to simulate different portfolio allocations and how Bitcoin would impact this allocation;
    
*   Track your Bitcoin node status;
    
*   Keep all data locally to improve privacy.
    

INSTALLATION
============

[](https://github.com/pxsocs/warden?screenshot=true#installation)

This is an Open Source project
------------------------------

We believe Open Source is the future of development for bitcoin. There is no other way when transparency and privacy are critical.

The code is not compiled and it can be easily audited. It can also be modified and distributed as anyone wishes.

Privacy
-------

[](https://github.com/pxsocs/warden?screenshot=true#privacy)

Most portfolio tracking tools ask for personal information and may track your IP and other information. Our experience is that even those who say they don't, may have log files at their systems that do track your IP and could be easily linked to your data.

### Troubleshooting

[](https://github.com/pxsocs/warden?screenshot=true#troubleshooting)

> If you get a message telling you that pip is not installed:

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip
```

> If you get a message that git was not found:

```shell
sudo apt-get install git
```

**Please note that this is ALPHA software. There is no guarantee that the information and analytics are correct. Also expect no customer support. Issues are encouraged to be raised through GitHub but they will be answered on a best efforts basis.**
