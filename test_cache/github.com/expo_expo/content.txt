[\[expo\] Add example VS Code debugger configurations (](https://github.com/expo/expo/commit/db4839e81dab329f2a0ecc0b557f56851ae50c03 "[expo] Add example VS Code debugger configurations (#24712)
# Why
VS Code integrated debugger launch configs have to be tweaked based on
your local setup, what exactly you want to test. So, you can't check in
a single config that works everywhere. But, we can provide an example
file with the most useful configs and gitignore the **launch.json** file
itself, so you can easily copy the configs, tweak them as needed, and
not worry about accidentally committing them.
# How
Added configs for debugging a Jest test and debugging the Expo CLI
against a test project to a **launch.json.example** file, and gitignored
**launch.json**. Added comments to describe what the values do and what
must be changed for each user.
# Test Plan

# Why
the `source-login-scripts.sh` introduced a lot of pain where the community reported much build errors from it. it doesn't support shells other than zsh and bash. this pr find a new way to deal with xcode building issues that it cannot find the correct nodejs path.

# How
react-native introduces `.xcode.env` and `.xcode.env.local` for developers to override the `$NODE_BINARY`: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/33546
to make sure building success from expo-constants, expo-updates, and also the app target when generating bundles. i would like to reuse the `.xcode.env` and `.xcode.env.local` from react-native. this pr further generates `.xcode.env.local` automatically for the app during `pod install`. we can ensure that `pod install` is executed from shell and nodejs is available. so we will generate `export NODE_BINARY=\"$(command -v node)\"` in the `.xcode.env.local`. for xcode, the path will be `$PODS_ROOT/../.xcode.env.local`, every xcode subprojects can source the file to get correct `$NODE_BINARY`.

[\[guides\] Add guideline for referencing app config (](https://github.com/expo/expo/commit/c4a32d0fdfa976ac1cd804268353659046619556 "[guides] Add guideline for referencing app config (#34092)
# Why
<!--
Please describe the motivation for this PR, and link to relevant GitHub
issues, forums posts, or feature requests.
-->
Sometimes, we reference multiple file formats for app config in a single
sentence. However, the reference term \"app config\" can be used when
there is no requirement to reference a specific format.
This PR adds a guideline about that to the writing style guide.

[\[haptics\]\[docs\] Minor fixes in API reference (](https://github.com/expo/expo/commit/becdbe00606e9cd401f1f50e38e2da3e81a6a5df "[haptics][docs] Minor fixes in API reference (#34287)
<!-- disable:changelog-checks -->
# Why
<!--
Please describe the motivation for this PR, and link to relevant GitHub
issues, forums posts, or feature requests.
-->
While going through the doc, found some formatting issues, missing
values for `Haptics.imapctStyle`, and incorrect platform sequence used
for `AndroidHaptics`.
# How
<!--
How did you build this feature or fix this bug and why?
-->
- Improve formatting (platform order usage and missing inline syntax
highlight) for `Haptics.impactAsync(style)` and
`Haptics.notificationAsync(type) definitions.
`.
- Refer to updated values of `Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle` in the
`Haptics.impactAsync(style)` definition.

# Why
fixes
```
console.error: Could not access feature flag
'enableBridgelessArchitecture' because native
module method
was not available
```
logged by the dev menu - there's incompatibility between JS (built for
77) and native (which can run 76) in
[setUpTimers](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blame/main/packages/react-native/Libraries/Core/setUpTimers.js).
it's super important to read the feature flags directly from the native
module which is the source of truth, not from the JS wrapping that's
done around it - otherwise incorrect feature flag values are reported
because some of the JS wrapping is evaluated at build time (not run
time).
# How
change reading of the feature flags so that it works for 76 as well as
77.
# Test Plan
`this branch`
new arch: iOS, Android both okay
old arch: iOS okay, Android not tested (hard to build for old arch due
to deps)

[\[ios\]\[android\]\[background-task\] add new package: expo-background-task (](https://github.com/expo/expo/commit/017446a303b18230c550db04cc40e3a2646658cb "[ios][android][background-task] add new package: expo-background-task (#33438)
# Why
`expo-background-fetch` uses deprecated APIs and we'd like to replace
these on both iOS and Android using the latest and greatest APIs. With
this new package we can deprecate the `expo-background-fetch` package
and move on.
The new APIs are
[`BGTaskScheduler`](https://devhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks/bgtaskscheduler)
API on iOS and the
[`WorkManager`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager)
API on Android.
These are the recommended APIs for background tasks.
# How
- Added expo-background-task package
- Added documentation for the background-task package
- Added test screen in BareExpo
- Added necessary UIBackgroundModes in Expo-go and Bare-Expo
# Test Plan
- Run in BareExpo on device (iOS) or simulator (android) and open the
BackgroundTask screen
- Test registration/unregistration
- Test running tasks
- Test running tasks only runs the `background-task` (see log output)
- Ensure that tasks are periodically repeated
# Checklist

It looks like we still have some objects in lfs from long ago. We can't remove these without rewriting history (which is impossible for this repo), but we can do our best to limit the bandwidth they use by instructing full clone operations not to download the files. That is at least theoretically what this config does: https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/man/git-lfs-fetch.adoc
# Test Plan
Push this and then do a full clone and see what shows up.

# Why
We've exceeded out bandwidth for git lfs for our github account. Looking at the usage (linked in task), this is due to lfs objects on this repo.
Closes ENG-13981.

```
It looks like we still have some objects in lfs from long ago. We can't remove these without rewriting history (which is impossible for this repo), but we can do our best to limit the bandwidth they use by instructing full clone operations not to download the files. That is at least theoretically what this config does: https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/man/git-lfs-fetch.adoc
# Test Plan
Push this and then do a full clone and see what shows up.

Adds a newer version of eslint-config-universe with base linter configurations. Each workspace does not yet have its own, more precise configuration right now.
The ESLint config contains root: true so that it doesn't inherit from ESLint configs higher up in the file system. There is also a prettierrc file that both prettier and eslint-config-universe will read i.e. our config is consistent.

Why
---
ESLint v8 came out awhile ago. This PR updates eslint-config-universe to support ESLint v8.
How
---
Most of the work was updating dependencies and switching our tests to use `eslint.ESLint` instead of `eslint.CLIEngine`. Read through the changelog of each dependency and confirmed the breaking changes don't affect us (dropping Node 10 was the most common one).
Updated some deprecated ESLint rules that had been moved to eslint-plugin-node, a new dependency.
This is pretty much a drop-in change but I bumped the major version since several dependencies were upgraded and there was a slightly higher peer dep requirement for `@babel/core`.

This moves the Expo client project as well as several of our other projects from the BSD license to the MIT license. The licenses are fairly comparable and are compatible. This (a) consistently licenses our latest code using the same license and (b) uses the same license as React and React Native. There should be no material impact to developers using Expo aside from one fewer license type they need to think about; generally standard BSD and MIT are well-accepted.

# Why
- This is required for using packages like `@mdx-js/mdx` in Expo. This
is a temporary fix while we wait for Metro upstream to add the same
feature. Only used with RSC and `EXPO_USE_FAST_RESOLVER=1`
- Also adds `import` condition to `react-server` bundles. This appears
to be the expected resolution condition pattern.

Introduction
------------

[](https://github.com/expo/expo?screenshot=true#introduction)

Expo is an open-source platform for making universal native apps that run on Android, iOS, and the web. It includes a universal runtime and libraries that let you build native apps by writing React and JavaScript.

This repository includes the Expo SDK, Modules API, Go app, CLI, Router, documentation, and various other supporting tools. [Expo Application Services (EAS)](https://expo.dev/eas) is a platform of hosted services that are deeply integrated with Expo open source tools. EAS helps you build, ship, and iterate on your app as an individual or a team.

Read the [Expo Community Guidelines](https://expo.dev/guidelines) before interacting in the repository. Thank you for helping keep the Expo community open and welcoming!
