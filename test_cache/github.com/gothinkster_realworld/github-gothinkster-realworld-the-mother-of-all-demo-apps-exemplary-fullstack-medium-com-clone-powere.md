While most "todo" demos provide an excellent cursory glance at a framework's capabilities, they typically don't convey the knowledge & perspective required to actually build _real_ applications with it.

**RealWorld** solves this by allowing you to choose any frontend (React, Angular, & more) and any backend (Node, Django, & more).

_Read the [full blog post announcing RealWorld on Medium.](https://medium.com/@ericsimons/introducing-realworld-6016654d36b5)_

Join us on [GitHub Discussions!](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/discussions) 🎉

Implementations
===============

[](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld?screenshot=true#implementations)

Over 100 implementations have been created using various languages, libraries, and frameworks.

Explore them on [**CodebaseShow**](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld).

Create a new implementation
===========================

[](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld?screenshot=true#create-a-new-implementation)

[**Create a new implementation \>\>\>**](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/implementation-creation/introduction)

Or you can [view upcoming implementations (WIPs)](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/discussions/categories/wip-implementations).

*   ["Introducing RealWorld 🙌"](https://medium.com/@ericsimons/introducing-realworld-6016654d36b5) by Eric Simons
*   Every tutorial is built against the same [API spec](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/blob/main/api) to ensure modularity of every frontend & backend
*   Every frontend utilizes the same handcrafted [Bootstrap 4 theme](https://github.com/gothinkster/conduit-bootstrap-template) for identical UI/UX
*   There is a hosted version of the backend API available for public usage, no API keys are required

cursory glance at a framework's capabilities, they typically don't convey the knowledge & perspective required to actually build _real_ applications with it.\n\n**RealWorld** solves this by allowing you to choose any frontend (React, Angular, & more) and any backend (Node, Django, & more).\n\n_Read the [full blog post announcing RealWorld on Medium.](https://medium.com/@ericsimons/introducing-realworld-6016654d36b5)_\n\nJoin us on [GitHub Discussions!](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/discussions) 🎉\n\nImplementations\n===============\n\n[](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld?screenshot=true#implementations)\n\nOver 100 implementations have been created using various languages, libraries, and frameworks.\n\nExplore them on [**CodebaseShow**](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld).\n\nCreate a new implementation\n===========================\n\n[](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld?screenshot=true#create-a-new-implementation)\n\n[**Create a new implementation

 [\"Introducing RealWorld 🙌\"](https://medium.com/@ericsimons/introducing-realworld-6016654d36b5) by Eric Simons\n*   Every tutorial is built against the same [API spec](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/blob/main/api) to ensure modularity of every frontend & backend\n*   Every frontend utilizes the same handcrafted [Bootstrap 4 theme](https://github.com/gothinkster/conduit-bootstrap-template) for identical UI/UX\n*   There is a hosted version of the backend API available for public usage, no API keys are required\n*
