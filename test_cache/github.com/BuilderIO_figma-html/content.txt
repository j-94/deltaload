Builder.io for Figma: AI generation, export to code, import from web
====================================================================

[![Image 14: Figma to HTML title](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a7fe84cabdb4c4733c8377447170130e82f4267a5b276a5ece71f4800ffce6bb/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e6275696c6465722e696f2f6170692f76312f696d6167652f617373657473253246594a494762346930316a7677305352644c3542742532466561666438653162396239303465353662666232316161633562333537383230)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a7fe84cabdb4c4733c8377447170130e82f4267a5b276a5ece71f4800ffce6bb/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e6275696c6465722e696f2f6170692f76312f696d6167652f617373657473253246594a494762346930316a7677305352644c3542742532466561666438653162396239303465353662666232316161633562333537383230)

Teach Figma how to speak code: generate designs via AI, convert designs to code, import from web.

How does it work
----------------

[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/figma-html?screenshot=true#how-does-it-work)

### Generate designs via AI

[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/figma-html?screenshot=true#generate-designs-via-ai)

1.  [Install the plugin](https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/747985167520967365/HTML-To-Figma)
2.  Create an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/signup), grab your [OpenAI key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), make sure you have [billing enabled](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview), and add your API key in the plugin
3.  Enter a prompt, and watch AI design in real time!

Troubleshooting: if having trouble with your OpenAI API calls, please follow [this guide](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6891831-error-code-429-you-exceeded-your-current-quota-please-check-your-plan-and-billing-details)

### Export designs to code

[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/figma-html?screenshot=true#export-designs-to-code)

1.  [Install the plugin](https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/747985167520967365/HTML-To-Figma)
2.  Ensure all layers you want to import use autolayout as described [here](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/import-from-figma)
3.  Click the "get code" button to launch into the [Builder.io](https://www.builder.io/) editor
4.  Make any final adjustments, and click "get code" at the top of Builder to view code output, or copy and paste it to content of a Builder account to publish live

Supports many code outputs, such as React, Vue, Svelte, Qwik, Solid, plain HTML/CSS, and more via [Mitosis](https://github.com/builderio/mitosis)

### Import webpages to Figma designs

[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/figma-html?screenshot=true#import-webpages-to-figma-designs)

1.  [Install the plugin](https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/747985167520967365/HTML-To-Figma)
2.  In Figma, open a new or existing document, then hit cmd+/ and search "html figma" and hit enter
3.  Enter a URL you want to import

Why?
----

[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/figma-html?screenshot=true#why)

*   Instantly convert designs into live webpages and code
*   Easily import real live site styles for a starting point for designs and prototypes
*   Quickly turn real site components into design components
*   Easy import from storybook, etc

Chrome Extension
----------------

[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/figma-html?screenshot=true#chrome-extension)

Want to capture a page behind an auth wall, or in a specific state you need to navigate to? Then the [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/efjcmgblfpkhbjpkpopkgeomfkokpaim) is for you!

Using the library
-----------------

[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/figma-html?screenshot=true#using-the-library)

```js
// npm install @builder.io/html-to-figma
import { htmlToFigma } from "@builder.io/html-to-figma";
const layers = htmlToFigma(document.body);
// E.g. send these to the REST API, or generate a .figma.json file that can be uploaded through the Figma plugin
```

Auto-layout Vectors
-------------------

[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/figma-html?screenshot=true#auto-layout-vectors)

When exporting Figma to Builder, the plugin requires all elements to be in auto-layout. However, it's not possible to auto-layout a vector. The alternative here is to use Figma's `rasterize selection` command on your vector. If the output of that is too low-resolution, then you can try this plugin: [https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/837846252158418235/Flatten-Selection-to-Bitmap](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/837846252158418235/Flatten-Selection-to-Bitmap).

If you want the Builder end-result to have a vector, then consider this rasterized selection as a placeholder, and swap it back with an SVG in the Builder editor.

Limitations
-----------

[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/figma-html?screenshot=true#limitations)

Importing HTML layers to Figma is a best-effort process. Even getting 90% there can save you a ton of time, only having to clean up a few things.

A few known limitations:

*   not all element types are supported (e.g. iframe, pseudoelements)
*   not all CSS properties are supported or fully supported
*   not all types of media are supported (video, animated gifs, etc)
*   all fonts have to be uploaded to Figma or a best effort fallback will be used

If you find any issues or have feedback at all please [make an issue](https://github.com/BuilderIO/html-to-figma/issues/new)

Architecture
------------

[](https://github.com/BuilderIO/figma-html?screenshot=true#architecture)

*   `builder.io/api/v1/html-to-figma`: API endpoint that converts a URL's layout to a Figma design. The logic of that endpoint lives in this repo, under [./lib/html-to-figma](https://github.com/BuilderIO/figma-html/blob/master/lib/html-to-figma).
*   `builder.io/api/v1/figma-to-builder`: API endpoint that converts a Figma design to a Builder content JSON. The logic of that endpoint lives in Builder's API.
