Warning

R3F v8 is not compatible with React 19 or Next 15, which uses React 19. Use the R3F v9 RC instead which can be installed with @react-three/fiber@rc.

Note

While we work on R3F v9 you can track compatibility of different libraries and common workarounds here.

@react-three/fiber

      

react-three-fiber is a React renderer for threejs.

Build your scene declaratively with re-usable, self-contained components that react to state, are readily interactive and can participate in React's ecosystem.

npm install three @types/three @react-three/fiber
Does it have limitations?

None. Everything that works in Threejs will work here without exception.

Is it slower than plain Threejs?

No. There is no overhead. Components render outside of React. It outperforms Threejs in scale due to React's scheduling abilities.

Can it keep up with frequent feature updates to Threejs?

Yes. It merely expresses Threejs in JSX, <mesh /> dynamically turns into new THREE.Mesh(). If a new Threejs version adds, removes or changes features, it will be available to you instantly without depending on updates to this library.

What does it look like?
Let's make a re-usable component that has its own state, reacts to user-input and participates in the render-loop. (live demo).	
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import React, { useRef, useState } from 'react'
import { Canvas, useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber'

function Box(props) {
  // This reference gives us direct access to the THREE.Mesh object
  const ref = useRef()
  // Hold state for hovered and clicked events
  const [hovered, hover] = useState(false)
  const [clicked, click] = useState(false)
  // Subscribe this component to the render-loop, rotate the mesh every frame
  useFrame((state, delta) => (ref.current.rotation.x += delta))
  // Return the view, these are regular Threejs elements expressed in JSX
  return (
    <mesh
      {...props}
      ref={ref}
      scale={clicked ? 1.5 : 1}
      onClick={(event) => click(!clicked)}
      onPointerOver={(event) => hover(true)}
      onPointerOut={(event) => hover(false)}>
      <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial color={hovered ? 'hotpink' : 'orange'} />
    </mesh>
  )
}

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <Canvas>
    <ambientLight intensity={Math.PI / 2} />
    <spotLight position={[10, 10, 10]} angle={0.15} penumbra={1} decay={0} intensity={Math.PI} />
    <pointLight position={[-10, -10, -10]} decay={0} intensity={Math.PI} />
    <Box position={[-1.2, 0, 0]} />
    <Box position={[1.2, 0, 0]} />
  </Canvas>,
)

First steps

You need to be versed in both React and Threejs before rushing into this. If you are unsure about React consult the official React docs, especially the section about hooks. As for Threejs, make sure you at least glance over the following links:

Make sure you have a basic grasp of Threejs. Keep that site open.
When you know what a scene is, a camera, mesh, geometry, material, fork the demo above.
Look up the JSX elements that you see (mesh, ambientLight, etc), all threejs exports are native to three-fiber.
Try changing some values, scroll through our API to see what the various settings and hooks do.
