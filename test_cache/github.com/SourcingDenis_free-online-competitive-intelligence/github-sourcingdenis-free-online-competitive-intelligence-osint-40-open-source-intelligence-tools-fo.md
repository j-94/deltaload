üîé 40+ open source intelligence tools for various internet investigations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

[](https://github.com/SourcingDenis/free-online-competitive-intelligence?screenshot=true#-40-open-source-intelligence-tools-for-various-internet-investigations)

Rather than go into how you do online competitive intelligence, I‚Äôm just going to run through a free list of tools that have earned themselves and honorable mention here and give you some awesome tidbits for finding information online.

I review competitive information on a daily basis; I have to warn you that its a lot of information.

Don‚Äôt be afraid of simply sitting down and playing with one or two tools a week and seeing what you come up with. The real magic begins to happen when you start discovering that one tool provides the secret ingredient to turbo-charge the next tool.

Every tool on this list is free¬†üåü
----------------------------------

[](https://github.com/SourcingDenis/free-online-competitive-intelligence?screenshot=true#every-tool-on-this-list-is-free)

(some of them may have premium paid upgrades, but they aren‚Äôt necessarily required.)

If you would like to find out about the how and why behind using these tools, check out my¬†[competitive intelligence](http://barryhurd.com/tag/competitive-intelligence/ "competitive intelligence")¬†posts.

### **Google Tools**

[](https://github.com/SourcingDenis/free-online-competitive-intelligence?screenshot=true#google-tools)

You can‚Äôt beat Google when it comes to free information and tons of data. The biggest issue with using Google effectively is understanding how to sift through massive volumes of data to find actionable nuggets of wisdom. To help you do that I‚Äôve include two link to a advanced search parameter cheat sheet and a walk-through of using advanced parameters. If you have a few minutes, you can also watch this official¬†[Google training video on advanced search parameters](http://www.google.com/insidesearch/landing/powersearching.html).

**Google Cheat Sheet ‚Äì Advanced Operators [http://www.googleguide.com/advanced\_operators\_reference.html](http://www.googleguide.com/advanced_operators_reference.html)**

### The actual Google Tools‚Ä¶

[](https://github.com/SourcingDenis/free-online-competitive-intelligence?screenshot=true#the-actual-google-tools)

**Google News  
**[http://news.google.com/nwshp](http://news.google.com/nwshp)This is probably one of the easiest tools to keep track of your industry, your competitors, and your prospects/clients. When you are signed into Google you have the option of personalizing the news topics and the sources they draw from (In my personal use I have it set to review¬†[TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/),¬†[Mashable](http://mashable.com/),¬†[GeekWire](http://geekwire.com/),¬†[Venturebeat](http://venturebeat.com/), etc to cover the start-up/tech scene.)[](http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends)  
**Custom Google Search Engine**  
[www.**google**.com/cse/](http://www.google.com/cse/)This is another awesome tool from Google. It allows you to control the sites Google uses for search results. If you have a list of 100 competitive sites you can use it to search them all for investor reports, instructional guides, quarterly results, client lists, etc.¬†[](http://www.google.com/cse/)

**Google Trends** [![Image 11](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5f335d68ffbabbe76e91dfc460ea3e49dab321e67c7131e58cb56bf96e334722/687474703a2f2f32736a6f643632696b667a7a37767a6e32773839626531352e7770656e67696e652e6e6574646e612d63646e2e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031322f30382f636f6d70657469746976652d696e74656c6c6967656e63652d676f6f676c652d7472656e64732d333030783134372e6a7067)](http://www.google.com/trends/?q=obama,romney&ctab=0&geo=us&geor=all&date=ytd&sort=0)  
[www.**google**.com/**trends**/](http://www.google.com/trends/)  
A great tool for understanding how keyword volume has changed over time. The chart to the right shows a review of Obama vs. Romney for the past twelve months and provides me with the ability to look at noteworthy news stories, drill down to local regions, or explore associated Google results.

[![Image 12](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/dfa1f7dda403a8f224471001615723fc2fcc82be6e1400a6e57059fc4a839ea8/687474703a2f2f32736a6f643632696b667a7a37767a6e32773839626531352e7770656e67696e652e6e6574646e612d63646e2e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031322f30382f636f6d70657469746976652d696e74656c6c6967656e63652d626573746275792d3330307839372e6a7067)](http://www.google.com/trends/?q=bestbuy.com&ctab=0&geo=us&geor=all&date=all&sort=0)**Google Trends for Websites**  
[**trends**.**google**.com/**websites**](http://trends.google.com/websites)  
Provides slightly different information when you enter a web domain (.com, .net, etc)  
This information details demand generation over time. A quick look at BestBuy.com shows us the buying patterns around holiday spikes for the past five years, the top ten states driving that demand, and the top cities within those states.

**Google Insights**  
[http://www.google.com/insights/search/](http://www.google.com/insights/search/)  
Google Insights is¬†**one of my favorite**¬†‚Äògo to‚Äô tools: it allows me to narrow data to specific categories, like finance, health, and tech. It shows me search volume distributed across regions and cities.

### **Social Media Tools¬†üèÖ**

[http://monitter.com/](http://monitter.com/)

### **Favorite Plugins¬†ü§ì**

[](https://github.com/SourcingDenis/free-online-competitive-intelligence?screenshot=true#favorite-plugins)

Here are a few plugins I use on a daily basis. Some of them have versions for other browsers if you are an IE, Chrome, or Safari person.

**Search Sidebar by Webmynd**  
[https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/firefox/addon/the-search-sidebar-by-webmynd/](https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/firefox/addon/the-search-sidebar-by-webmynd/)  
Provides a sidebar on your search results page that includes additional results from Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Wikipedia, and many more content sites.

**Search Engine Tags**  
[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/SearchEngineTags/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/SearchEngineTags/)  
This allows you to search for information using an additional layer of meta data that you normally don‚Äôt see. It provides access to site and topic specific results based on using tags in your searches (it requires a little practice to learn, but provides some highly useful results.)

**Autopager**  
[https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/firefox/addon/autopager/](https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/firefox/addon/autopager/)  
Allows you to automatically load results from the next page‚Ä¶ and the next (into infinity.)¬† When using sites like Google you can see 10 to 10,000 results to search for specific items hidden well beyond page one of the results.

**Fireshot**  
[https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/firefox/addon/fireshot/](https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/firefox/addon/fireshot/)  
Allows you to take screenshots and has dozens of very useful features.When used for competitive intelligence it allows you to quickly gather visual records and note them.

**Firebug**  
[https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/firefox/addon/firebug/](https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/firefox/addon/firebug/)  
A development tool that allows you to see the code structure for any web page. Very useful for finding software vendors who provide different platform capabilities to your competitors.

**Scrapbook**  
[https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/firefox/addon/scrapbook/](https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/firefox/addon/scrapbook/?src=search)  
Add visual bookmarks into a catalog that can be tagged and categorized. Competitive Intelligence professionals can quickly sort reference sites and create visual archives for team collaboration.

**List Open URLs**  
[https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/firefox/addon/list-open-urls/](https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/firefox/addon/list-open-urls/?src=search)

### **HR Related Tools üìû**

[](https://github.com/SourcingDenis/free-online-competitive-intelligence?screenshot=true#hr-related-tools-)

**LinkedIn**  
[http://linkedin.com](http://linkedin.com/)  
If you don‚Äôt use Linkedin for competitive and market intelligence you are really missing something. Linkedin provides all sorts of data about employees, relationships, company data, new hires, people that left, press releases, org charts, open positions, and more‚Ä¶

**Glassdoor**  
[http://glassdoor.com](http://glassdoor.com/)  
Past employees share a treasure trove about the marketplace you deal with. As a standard competitive intelligence sweep I usually recommend checking the top five to ten competitors, top client/prospects, and your vendors.

### **DATA Sources¬†üìà**

[](https://github.com/SourcingDenis/free-online-competitive-intelligence?screenshot=true#data-sources)

**Copernic**

**Yahoo Pipes**  
[http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/)This isn‚Äôt really a data source, but a web based tool that allows you to aggregate, mash-up, and syndicate other sources of data. It is incredibly useful as a tool to build ‚Äòminimum viable models‚Äô for web research (but does have a learning curve.)

**GNIP**  
[http://gnip.com](http://gnip.com/)  
Gnip provides data from dozens of top social sites ranging from Facebook and Twitter to Youtube and Vimeo. By using a single API it allows you to access thousands of data fields that can be extracted for all sorts of competitive intelligence on businesses, community audiences, and specific people.

**DataSift**  
[http://datasift.com](http://datasift.com/)  
Is another social media data provider. They have a tremendous amount of information available (some overlap with Gnip, some is unique.) It is one of the few social media data providers that can provide full access to the Twitter firehose.

**Spinn3r**  
[http://spinn3r.com](http://spinn3r.com/)  
Yet another social media data company, but with focus on real-time indexing of the blogosphere or content that you specifically want. Very useful for¬† processing large amounts of social content found on niche community sites that don‚Äôt make it onto Gnip or Datasift‚Äôs lists.
