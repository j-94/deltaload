Auth.js

Authentication for the Web.

Open Source. Full Stack. Own Your Data.

     

Auth.js is a set of open-source packages that are built on standard Web APIs for authentication in modern applications with any framework on any platform in any JS runtime.

Features
Flexible and easy to use
Designed to work with any OAuth service, it supports 2.0+, OIDC
Built-in support for many popular sign-in services
Email/Passwordless authentication
Passkeys/WebAuthn support
Bring Your Database - or none! - stateless authentication with any backend (Active Directory, LDAP, etc.)
Runtime-agnostic, runs anywhere! (Docker, Node.js, Serverless, etc.)
Own your data

Auth.js can be used with or without a database.

An open-source solution that allows you to keep control of your data
Built-in support for MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB, SQLite, GraphQL, etc.
Works great with databases from popular hosting providers
Secure by default
Promotes the use of passwordless sign-in mechanisms
Designed to be secure by default and encourage best practices for safeguarding user data
Uses Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Tokens on POST routes (sign in, sign out)
Default cookie policy aims for the most restrictive policy appropriate for each cookie
When JSON Web Tokens are used, they are encrypted by default (JWE) with A256CBC-HS512
Features tab/window syncing and session polling to support short-lived sessions
Attempts to implement the latest guidance published by Open Web Application Security Project

Advanced configuration allows you to define your routines to handle controlling what accounts are allowed to sign in, for encoding and decoding JSON Web Tokens and to set custom cookie security policies and session properties, so you can control who can sign in and how often sessions have to be re-validated.

TypeScript

Auth.js libraries are written with type safety in mind. Check out the docs for more information.

Security

If you think you have found a vulnerability (or are not sure) in Auth.js or any of the related packages (i.e. Adapters), we ask you to read our Security Policy to reach out responsibly. Please do not open Pull Requests/Issues/Discussions before consulting with us.
