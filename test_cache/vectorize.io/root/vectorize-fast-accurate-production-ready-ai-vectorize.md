[Multiple Sources in RAG Pipelines: Why More is Better](https://vectorize.io/multiple-sources-in-rag-pipelines-why-more-is-better/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When building a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, one of the most impactful decisions you can make is to incorporate multiple data sources rather than relying on a single source of truth. While it might seem simpler to just pull from your documentation or a single knowledge base, the benefits of a multi-source approach far outweigh \[…\]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the race to build better AI applications, there’s often an assumption that bigger is better when it comes to language models. However, with careful attention to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline design and prompt engineering, smaller, more cost-effective models can often perform just as well as their larger counterparts. Here’s how you can optimize your \[…\]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you’re implementing retrieval augmented generation (RAG), there’s one crucial component you might be missing: a reranking model. While vector similarity search has become the go-to method for retrieving relevant context, relying solely on similarity scores can lead to suboptimal results. Let me show you why reranking is not just an optional enhancement, but a \[…\]
