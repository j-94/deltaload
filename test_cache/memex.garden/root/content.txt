    Memex has the lowest friction of all the tools I endlessly try and experiment with. I am rolling in data of research for patients, students and studies and need a robust system to collect, collate, curate and file all my searches, webpages and resources I find online. Memex helps me to find exactly what I need, when I need it.
    
*   I use Memex to create watch lists for founders, companies and developer tools. The webpage/youtube video summaries save me so much time skimming documents and that feature gets used daily. It’s a huge relief especially when you’re juggling multiple projects. I wish I had this when I was a student!
    
*   We all binge on the internet, consuming endless streams of information, often to the point of mental exhaustion. I used to think I needed to find a way to remember everything I read or saw in order to get rid of that feeling. With Memex, it's not about cramming everything in. It's about sifting through the noise, highlighting what truly resonates, and organizing those gems. Once you've marked it, it's there for you, always. It is a beautifully designed extension for your brain, a safeguard against the digital overload.
    
*   Memex saved me countless hours researching and learning. It gives me durable notes that I can take with me into almost any notetaking app. I can even share those notes with classmates or research partners! The AI support saves me so much precious research time by summarizing pdfs and long websites before I read something I might not want to read.
    
*   As a researcher with ADHD I can't live without Memex. It helps me to reduce context switches and keep track of all my research in an all-in-one system.

### We want to be a financially sustainable business while avoiding profit maximisation incentives. These often lead to mission drift or extractive behaviour like lock-ins or optimising algorithms for grabbing attention instead of improving quality.This is why all our team and investors have a performance oriented cap on their profits, giving the company more economic freedom to "do the right things" while incentivising a growing business.
