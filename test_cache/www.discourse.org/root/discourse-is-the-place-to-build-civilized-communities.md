> The altMBA teaches people how to lead in a changing world, and it works because of the community. Our workshops are built on conversation, which is also why they’re built on Discourse. This one indispensable tool curbs the worst parts of social media and brings an incredible flexibility to our tech stack. It’s the part of our business I never worry about because I’ve seen the care, skill, and thoughtfulness that goes into building Discourse.

> The more we get to know the Discourse platform, the more we fall in love with it. It’s simple and intuitive, but much more powerful than you imagine. We don’t know how many times we got lost cruising around checking out all the features. And, as a plus, we really enjoy working with the Discourse team.

> I wanna shout out the team at [@discourse](https://twitter.com/discourse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). Often we see Twitter used as a resource to commiserate on bad experiences with services but it’s wonderful to amplify the extraordinary. Every time I’ve needed help, the team at Discourse has been super responsive and helpful. Y’all rock.
