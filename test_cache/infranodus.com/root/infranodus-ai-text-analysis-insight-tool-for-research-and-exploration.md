*   [### SEO & Market Research Learn what people search for but don't find. Case Study](https://infranodus.com/#seomarket)

#### Use Case: Reveal the main topics and find the gaps between them

* * *

  

##### Problem: How can you go beyond generic AI insights?

Current AI tools provide generic summaries, offering no competitive advantage over others using the same solutions. Most existing natural language processing tools are either overly simplistic or overly complex, making it difficult to uncover hidden patterns and gaps in ideas. Their summaries tend to be superficial, and achieving deeper insights often demands advanced NLP programming skills.

##### Solution: Represent any text as a knowledge graph to see patterns and gaps between ideas.

InfraNodus will represent text as a network and use powerful graph analysis algorithms to identify and highlight the most influential keywords, topics, and their relations. You, the human, can work together with the built-in AI to see patterns, topical clusters, and — more importantly — reveal the blind spots between them. This can be useful in research and innovation for understanding a market, creating a compelling discourse, and identifying gaps between ideas so you can develop them further.

#### Use Case: SEO and market research

* * *

  

##### Problem: How to find what people search for but do not yet find?

Identify the gap between the current informational demand and supply in order to know which keywords to target in your content and marketing strategy.

##### Solution: Use InfraNodus to build a graph that shows the difference between the demand and supply.

InfraNodus will import search results for your query, build a graph for it, and overlay it with the related search phrases graph. This way you can see the current picture of informational demand and supply, as well as the main topical clusters within.

You can use this insight to know what keywords to target when creating the content and marketing strategy. You can also compare the current demand (the search queries used) vs. current supply (the search results people get) to see what's missing and address those gaps with your content strategy.

#### Use Case: AI-augmented brainstorming

* * *

  

##### Problem: How to generate new ideas?

Whether you are brainstorming, doing research, or writing, you may experience writer's block or simply get stuck for new ideas.

##### Solution: InfraNodus will represent your text as a network, providing a visual overview and helping you find the gaps where the new ideas are hiding. It will then use the AI to help you generate research questions that bridge those gaps.

Our studies [have shown](https://noduslabs.com/publications) that network representation of text encourages one to think in terms of connections, helping you make new links between the different parts of your text and make your discourse more coherent.

You will also be able to see the structural gaps in your writing: that's where the new ideas are hiding.

#### Use Case: Qualitative research and thematic analysis of open-ended responses and customer reviews

* * *

  

##### Problem: Struggling to understand what your customers truly think?

Open-ended survey responses are difficult to analyze. Basic positive / negative categorizations fall short, and tag clouds often miss the context.

##### Solution: Uncover patterns in open-ended survey responses using network graphs.

InfraNodus visualizes customer feedback as a word graph, where words used within the same response are interconnected.

This representation will reveal the patterns and context in your customers' responses and reviews, allowing you to easily identify key topics as well as hidden relationships that other tools might miss.

How Does InfraNodus Work?
-------------------------

InfraNodus visualizes any text as a knowledge graph. Drawing an analogy from social sciences, words are represented as nodes, while their co-occurrences create the connections between them. This network representation enables the use of advanced graph theory algorithms to identify clusters of related ideas, highlight the most influential concepts and hidden intermediaries, and reveal gaps within the discourse.

Additionally, AI-driven algorithms are employed to generate insights and new ideas for any discourse based on the topical clusters and gaps discovered. Below is a more detailed explanation, including a link to a peer-reviewed paper that outlines our methodology:

1

#### 1\. Add Any Text or Data: Import or Use a Live Editor

You can use this approach for your research, creative writing, marketing feedback study, SEO purposes, news analysis, etc.

Add any text (speech-to-text available), notes, or import your Gephi graph, Evernote data, Twitter feed, or Google search results snippets.

The text is converted into a graph where the words are the nodes and the co-occurrences are the connections between them, so you can see all the disjointed bits and pieces of data at once, as a big picture.

[More in our Whitepaper](http://bit.ly/infrapdfhomepage)

![Image 47: Create a Text Network Graph](https://infranodus.com/images/front/infranodus-step1-adding-text.png)

2

#### 2\. Get a Visual Overview: From Unstructured Text to Structured Data

The network will then be generated from the text or data you added. The most influential words in the graph (nodes with the highest betweenness centrality) are shown bigger, while the words (nodes) that occur more often together are aligned into topical clusters and have distinct colors (using the modularity community detection algorithm and Force-Atlas layout).

The graph will show you not only the main topics and the most influential terms but also the _relations_ between them, making it a much better visual summary tool than traditional tag clouds because you can now see the context for every idea.

Natural language processing and text analysis algorithms are used to turn your unstructured text into structured data and provide additional insights such as topic modeling, sentiment, bigrams, and various other advanced network stats.

![Image 48: Overview Data with Text Network Visualization](https://infranodus.com/images/front/infranodus-step2-network-graph.png)

3

#### 3\. Generate Insight: Discover Relations and Blind Spots using Network Visualization and GPT-4 AI

InfraNodus will identify the structural gaps in the network: parts of the textual data graph that could be connected but are not (the blind spots).

It will propose the different ways how you can bridge these gaps to produce insight and generate new ideas.

You can also export your data as a CSV file (with the InfraNodus insights) for further analysis or to use as training data for your neural network applications.

About InfraNodus: Our Philosophy
--------------------------------

Gregory Bateson coined a beautiful term: "ecology of the mind". What is a mind that is ecological? It has the ability to have an overview, but it can also zoom in on any idea. It embraces diversity, but it can also obsess over one thing when needed. It can discover the obvious, but it can also reveal the hidden and ponder the gaps that have yet to be bridged. Focused, yet adaptive. Rational, yet poetic.

InfraNodus is a tool that is developed to help you think this way. It is made to promote ecological dynamics and diversity on a cognitive level. InfraNodus represents ideas as a network, so you can discover relations and patterns within. Based on this representation, you can enhance your perspective on any discourse and explore nuances of meaning that might otherwise remain hidden.

[Our research shows](https://noduslabs.com/publications) that network representation helps avoid cognitive bias and encourages connecting ideas in new ways. This can be very helpful for reading, writing, scientific research, and marketing analysis.

If you are interested in supporting our work, you can [sign up](https://infranodus.com/signup), learn more about [our philosophy](https://infranodus.com/about/our-story), and [join our team](https://infranodus.com/jobs).

We also provide an API to ensure that this way of thinking is available not only to humans, but also to other machines, applications, AI programs, and machine learning algorithms.

### Cognitive Variability: Panarchic Thinking with InfraNodus

![Image 51: Panarchic thinking](https://infranodus.com/images/front/network-ecology-panarchy.png)

InfraNodus is specifically designed to promote cognitive variability. Too often, people get stuck in certain ideas or thought patterns. InfraNodus can be used as a "mind antivirus" against obsessive loops — biased ideas, mundane patterns, totalitarian thinking, propaganda, and narrow-mindedness — proposing a pan~archic form of thinking that spans a range of states and modalities.

We view thinking as an ecological process, intimately tied to the surrounding ecosystem (context) and resources (attention, data, knowledge). Moments of growth are followed by saturation and decline, which create opportunities for optimization and reorganization. InfraNodus modulates this process, helping you find balance between openness and coherence. It does this by encouraging variability in both scale (high-level ideas vs. underlying nuances) and intent (focusing vs. exploration, connecting ideas vs. disrupting them). The main is a dynamic, non-equilibrium state that guides you through various stages, each of which benefits a different aspect of the research process.

To learn more about this approach, please read about our [research framework](https://infranodus.com/about/research-framework), [ecological thinking](https://infranodus.com/about/ecological-thinking), and [cognitive variability methodology](https://infranodus.com/about/cognitive-variability).

Technical Support
-----------------

Our [support portal](https://support.noduslabs.com/) contains a wealth of information on AI-enhanced text analysis, network science, data visualization, and their applications. You can learn how to create new network graphs, interpret them, discover hidden patterns in your data and share the results of your research.

You are welcome to contact us at any time via [our Discord community](https://discord.gg/v4BWAvTfB9) or by submitting a [support ticket](https://support.noduslabs.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). We are always happy to help you with any questions you might have and recommend the most effective ways to use InfraNodus for your research, writing, marketing, or any other purposes.

###### 1\. How to Create a New Graph

The most basic way to create a new graph is to use the hashtags. Each hashtag is a node, their co-occurrence is the connection between them. You can also use normal text to build your text graphs automatically. [More on Creating the Graphs](https://support.noduslabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013595519-How-to-create-a-network-graph)

###### 2\. How to Read and Interpret Network Visualization

Studies have shown that diagrams and especially network representation of data makes you think more of connections in your data. You can identify the main elements as well as the relations between them and — most importantly — discover the gaps in your knowledge using the graphs. [More on Reading the Graphs](https://support.noduslabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013596359-How-to-Interpret-Text-Network-Graphs)

###### 3\. Find the Right Excerpt in Text

Network graphs are great for non-linear reading. Look at the graph, find the part you like, click on the nodes, and you'll see the excerpt of your original data that contains this exact combination. [More on Nonlinear Reading](https://support.noduslabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013596879-Search-and-Find-Relevant-Parts-of-Text-using-a-Network-Graph)

###### 4\. How to Import Text and PDF files

You can import and visualize your text files or PDF documents. In order to do that, just upload the file and InfraNodus will do the rest. [More on Visualizing PDFs](https://support.noduslabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013525820-Adding-a-Text-File-or-a-PDF-Document)

Learn More](https://infranodus.com/#insight)\n*   [### Qualitative Analysis Analyze open-ended surveys, interviews, etc. Case Study](https://infranodus.com/#sentiment)\n*   [### SEO & Market Research Learn what people search for but don't find. Case Study](https://infranodus.com/#seomarket)\n\n#### Use Case: Reveal the main topics and find the gaps between them\n\n* * *\n\n  \n\n##### Problem: How can you go beyond generic AI insights?\n\nCurrent AI tools provide generic summaries, offering no competitive advantage over others using the same solutions. Most existing natural language processing tools are either overly simplistic or overly complex, making it difficult to uncover hidden patterns and gaps in ideas. Their summaries tend to be superficial, and achieving deeper insights often demands advanced NLP programming skills.\n\n##### Solution: Represent any text as a knowledge graph to see patterns and gaps between ideas.\n\nInfraNodus will represent text as a network and use powerful graph analysis algorithms to identify and highlight the most influential keywords, topics, and their relations. You, the human, can work together with the built-in AI to see patterns, topical clusters, and — more importantly — reveal the blind spots between them. This can be useful in research and innovation for understanding a market, creating a compelling discourse, and identifying gaps between ideas so you can develop them further.\n\n[Learn More](https://infranodus.com/docs/network-visualization-text-mining)    [Try It Out](https://infranodus.com/signup)\n\n#### Use Case: SEO and market research\n\n* * *\n\n  \n\n##### Problem: How to find what people search for but do not yet find?\n\nIdentify the gap between the current informational demand and supply in order to know which keywords to target in your content and marketing strategy.\n\n##### Solution: Use InfraNodus to build a graph that shows the difference between the demand and supply.\n\nInfraNodus will import search results for your query, build a graph for it, and overlay it with the related search phrases graph. This way you can see the current picture of informational demand and supply, as well as the main topical clusters within.\n\nYou can use this insight to know what keywords to target when creating the content and marketing strategy. You can also compare the current demand (the search queries used) vs. current supply (the search results people get) to see what's missing and address those gaps with your content strategy.\n\n[Try It Out](https://infranodus.com/signup)\n\n#### Use Case: AI-augmented brainstorming\n\n* * *\n\n  \n\n##### Problem: How to generate new ideas?\n\nWhether you are brainstorming, doing research, or writing, you may experience writer's block or simply get stuck for new ideas.\n\n##### Solution: InfraNodus will represent your text as a network, providing a visual overview and helping you find the gaps where the new ideas are hiding. It will then use the AI to help you generate research questions that bridge those gaps.\n\nOur studies [have shown](https://noduslabs.com/publications) that network representation of text encourages one to think in terms of connections, helping you make new links between the different parts of your text and make your discourse more coherent.\n\nYou will also be able to see the structural gaps in your writing: that's where the new ideas are hiding.\n\n[Learn More](https://infranodus.com/docs/generate-insight)    [Try It Out](https://infranodus.com/signup)\n\n#### Use Case: Qualitative research and thematic analysis of open-ended responses and customer reviews\n\n* * *\n\n  \n\n##### Problem: Struggling to understand what your customers truly think?\n\nOpen-ended survey responses are difficult to analyze. Basic positive / negative categorizations fall short, and tag clouds often miss the context.\n\n##### Solution: Uncover patterns in open-ended survey responses using network graphs.\n\nInfraNodus visualizes customer feedback as a word graph, where words used within the same response are interconnected.\n\nThis representation will reveal the patterns and context in your customers' responses and reviews, allowing you to easily identify key topics as well as hidden relationships that other tools might miss.\n\n[Thematic Analysis Case Study](https://support.noduslabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/8825622679580-Qualitative-Research-using-Text-Network-Thematic-Analysis-Surveys-Interviews-Questionnaires-Free-form-Responses)    [Try It Out](https://infranodus.com/signup)\n\nInfraNodus Graph Examples\n-------------------------\n\n  \n\nReal-Time Data Analysis\n-----------------------\n\nNews of the day, Google search results, Tweets, Amazon reviews.\n\nResearch Papers, Notes, and Books\n\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nAnalyze PDF files, Evernote or Obsidian notes, books, articles.\n\nMind Maps and Knowledge Graphs\n------------------------------\n\nUse the \\[\\[wiki links\\]\\] syntax to create custom knowledge graphs.\n\n  \n \n\n* * *\n\n \n\nStart Using InfraNodus\n----------------------\n\nSign up for an account now, so you can get insight using this tool for your own data and texts.\n\nHow Does InfraNodus Work?\n-------------------------\n\nInfraNodus visualizes any text as a knowledge graph. Drawing an analogy from social sciences, words are represented as nodes, while their co-occurrences create the connections between them. This network representation enables the use of advanced graph theory algorithms to identify clusters of related ideas, highlight the most influential concepts and hidden intermediaries, and reveal gaps within the discourse.\n\nAdditionally, AI-driven algorithms are employed to generate insights and new ideas for any discourse based on the topical clusters and gaps discovered. Below is a more detailed explanation, including a link to a peer-reviewed paper that outlines our methodology:\n\n1\n\n#### 1\\. Add Any Text or Data: Import or Use a Live Editor\n\nYou can use this approach for your research, creative writing, marketing feedback study, SEO purposes, news analysis, etc.\n\nAdd any text (speech-to-text available), notes, or import your Gephi graph, Evernote data, Twitter feed, or Google search results snippets.\n\nThe text is converted into a graph where the words are the nodes and the co-occurrences are the connections between them, so you can see all the disjointed bits and pieces of data at once, as a big picture.\n\n[More in our Whitepaper](http://bit.ly/infrapdfhomepage)\n\n![Image 47: Create a Text Network Graph](https://infranodus.com/images/front/infranodus-step1-adding-text.png)\n\n2\n\n#### 2\\. Get a Visual Overview: From Unstructured Text to Structured Data\n\nThe network will then be generated from the text or data you added. The most influential words in the graph (nodes with the highest betweenness centrality) are shown bigger, while the words (nodes) that occur more often together are aligned into topical clusters and have distinct colors (using the modularity community detection algorithm and Force-Atlas layout).\n\nThe graph will show you not only the main topics and the most influential terms but also the _relations_ between them, making it a much better visual summary tool than traditional tag clouds because you can now see the context for every idea.\n\nNatural language processing and text analysis algorithms are used to turn your unstructured text into structured data and provide additional insights such as topic modeling, sentiment, bigrams, and various other advanced network stats.\n\n![Image 48: Overview Data with Text Network Visualization](https://infranodus.com/images/front/infranodus-step2-network-graph.png)\n\n3\n\n#### 3\\. Generate Insight: Discover Relations and Blind Spots using Network Visualization and GPT-4 AI\n\nInfraNodus will identify the structural gaps in the network: parts of the textual data graph that could be connected but are not (the blind spots).\n\nIt will propose the different ways how you can bridge these gaps to produce insight and generate new ideas.\n\nYou can also export your data as a CSV file (with the InfraNodus insights) for further analysis or to use as training data for your neural network applications.\n\n![Image 49: Generating Insight with Structural Gaps](https://infranodus.com/images/front/infranodus-step3-insight-generation.png)\n\n### Methodology, Whitepaper, Citations:\n\nTo learn more about the algorithms used in InfraNodus and for citations, please, refer to this peer-reviewed paper:\n\nParanyushkin, D (2019).

What is a mind that is ecological? It has the ability to have an overview, but it can also zoom in on any idea. It embraces diversity, but it can also obsess over one thing when needed. It can discover the obvious, but it can also reveal the hidden and ponder the gaps that have yet to be bridged. Focused, yet adaptive. Rational, yet poetic.\n\nInfraNodus is a tool that is developed to help you think this way. It is made to promote ecological dynamics and diversity on a cognitive level. InfraNodus represents ideas as a network, so you can discover relations and patterns within. Based on this representation, you can enhance your perspective on any discourse and explore nuances of meaning that might otherwise remain hidden.\n\n[Our research shows](https://noduslabs.com/publications) that network representation helps avoid cognitive bias and encourages connecting ideas in new ways. This can be very helpful for reading, writing, scientific research, and marketing analysis.\n\nIf you are interested in supporting our work, you can [sign up](https://infranodus.com/signup), learn more about [our philosophy](https://infranodus.com/about/our-story), and [join our team](https://infranodus.com/jobs).\n\nWe also provide an API to ensure that this way of thinking is available not only to humans, but also to other machines, applications, AI programs, and machine learning algorithms.\n\n_Dmitry Paranyushkin, Founder_\n\n[Learn More About InfraNodus](https://infranodus.com/about/about)\n\n### Cognitive Variability: Panarchic Thinking with InfraNodus\n\n![Image 51: Panarchic thinking](https://infranodus.com/images/front/network-ecology-panarchy.png)\n\nInfraNodus is specifically designed to promote cognitive variability. Too often, people get stuck in certain ideas or thought patterns. InfraNodus can be used as a \"mind antivirus\" against obsessive loops — biased ideas, mundane patterns, totalitarian thinking, propaganda, and narrow-mindedness — proposing a pan~archic form of thinking that spans a range of states and modalities.\n\nWe view thinking as an ecological process, intimately tied to the surrounding ecosystem (context) and resources (attention, data, knowledge). Moments of growth are followed by saturation and decline, which create opportunities for optimization and reorganization. InfraNodus modulates this process, helping you find balance between openness and coherence. It does this by encouraging variability in both scale (high-level ideas vs. underlying nuances) and intent (focusing vs. exploration, connecting ideas vs. disrupting them). The main is a dynamic, non-equilibrium state that guides you through various stages, each of which benefits a different aspect of the research process.\n\nTo learn more about this approach, please read about our [research framework](https://infranodus.com/about/research-framework), [ecological thinking](https://infranodus.com/about/ecological-thinking), and [cognitive variability methodology](https://infranodus.com/about/cognitive-variability).\n\n  \n\nTestimonials\n------------\n\nInfraNodus is used by researchers, writers, marketing professionals, corporations, and NGOs — Greenpeace, Procter & Gamble, and others.
