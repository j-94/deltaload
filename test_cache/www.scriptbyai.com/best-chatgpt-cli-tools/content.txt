What Is Command Line Interface
------------------------------

![Image 39: Command Line Interface](https://www.scriptbyai.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Command-Line-Interface.webp)

A Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer program or operating system by entering commands in the form of text lines. CLI tools typically offer a minimalistic interface, focusing on functionality and performance rather than visual design. Users can execute commands by typing them directly into the command prompt or terminal window, often followed by relevant parameters or arguments.

while graphical user interfaces (GUIs) offer a more visually appealing and user-friendly experience, Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) provide a range of advantages that can make them a more suitable choice for professionals and power users working with ChatGPT. By offering increased speed, efficiency, automation capabilities, customization options, resource efficiency, and cross-platform compatibility, CLI tools enable users to unlock the full potential of conversational AI models like ChatGPT.
