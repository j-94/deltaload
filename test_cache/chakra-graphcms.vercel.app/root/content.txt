What is a Headless CMS?

A Headless CMS is a content repository that delivers content to any platform or device via API. The intended consumption of this content is by devices in a raw structured format, such as HTML or JSON, and isn't meant for human consumption until rendered on the end device.

What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need, and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
