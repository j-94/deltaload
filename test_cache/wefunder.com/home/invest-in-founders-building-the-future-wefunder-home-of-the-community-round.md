Why invest on Wefunder?
-----------------------

Support founders, build your portfolio, and join a community.

Invest and receive equity

Unlike Kickstarter or Indiegogo where you pledge money for products and perks, you invest money for equity on Wefunder.

Build wealth over time

Build an investment portfolio for the long-term by leveraging your unique knowledge and the wisdom of the crowd.

Get front row seats

When you invest, you'll get exclusive investor updates and opportunities to contribute to the companies you love.

Never invest more than you can afford to lose

Startups are riskier than public companies, and even the best founders fail. Plan to hold your investments for the long term. Expect to win big or lose all.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Any tips for a first-time investor on Wefunder?

1.  Only invest what you can afford to lose.
2.  Only invest in what you understand. Preferably a product or mission that you love.
3.  Do your research. You also can ask the founders a question on their money profile.
4.  Diversify. It's better to make multiple small investments rather than on large one. Plus, it'll help you learn more.
5.  Look at the Lead Investor. Has a more experienced investor invested in the company under the same terms as you? Why are they investing?

Note that these are tips, not investment recommendations. You should make your own decisions when deciding what to invest in.

Where does my money go after I invest?

Wefunder is prohibited by law from touching your money. When you invest, your funds are transferred to an escrow account. If the raise succeeds, your money will be released to the startup. Otherwise, it will be refunded to you.

How do I know the worth of my investment?

As there is no liquid secondary market for private securities like the New York Stock Exchange, it’s difficult for us to provide a dynamically updated value for your investment. The best way to approximate the value of your investment is to compare the company’s valuation from the round you invested in with their most recent valuation.

If the company IPOs, you’ll be able to track the value of your shares the same way you would for public company stocks.

How long before I see a return?

The amount of time it takes to see a return is highly dependent on the type of investment contract. On average, companies on Wefunder that earn a return take around 7 years to do so.

Only invest what you can afford to lose.\n2.  Only invest in what you understand. Preferably a product or mission that you love.\n3.  Do your research. You also can ask the founders a question on their money profile.\n4.  Diversify. It's better to make multiple small investments rather than on large one. Plus, it'll help you learn more.\n5.  Look at the Lead Investor. Has a more experienced investor invested in the company under the same terms as you? Why are they investing?\n\nNote that these are tips, not investment recommendations. You should make your own decisions when deciding what to invest in.\n\nWhere does my money go after I invest?\n\nWefunder is prohibited by law from touching your money. When you invest, your funds are transferred to an escrow account. If the raise succeeds, your money will be released to the startup. Otherwise, it will be refunded to you.\n\nHow do I know the worth of my investment?\n\nAs there is no liquid secondary market for private securities like the New York Stock Exchange, it’s difficult for us to provide a dynamically updated value for your investment. The best way to approximate the value of your investment is to compare the company’s valuation from the round you invested in with their most recent valuation.\n\nIf the company IPOs, you’ll be able to track the value of your shares the same way you would for public company stocks.\n\nHow long before I see a return?\n\nThe amount of time it takes to see a return is highly dependent on the type of investment contract. On average, companies on Wefunder that earn a return take around 7 years to do so.\n\n[More Investor FAQs](https://help.wefunder.com/#/investor/getting-started-for-investors)\n\nReady to fund the future?\n-------------------------\n\nInvest in the founders, products, and missions you love\n\n*   \"I am a huge Mercury stan!
