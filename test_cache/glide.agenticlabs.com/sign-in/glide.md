Glide helps you tackle hard(er) software engineering problems with AI.

Here‘s how it works:

Glide
+-- connect repo
+-- describe task   
+-- search code
+-- generate && edit technical design document
    +-- context
    +-- goals
    +-- proposed code changes
    +-- alternative solutions
        

Login

to access your private repos

We ask for repo access to tailor code generation to your project. We only access your repo when you work on it in Glide. We don‘t store your code.

You can change or revoke permissions any time.
