    3 days late being delivered. Several sheets cracked on delivery. No packaging at all to protect them. No real apology, no communication re delivery delay at all. Replacement sheets still yet to arrive. One very arrogant employee claiming they are the best company and most cost effective. If you can buy from someone else I certainly would.

    We informed you about your replacements being scheduled for delivery and provided you with the exact date. The communication has been top notch and thanks for that. Regarding the response, it could not be any more accurate but we are sorry to see it seemed arrogant to you. We are indeed the number one supplier in the UK and we are proud of being able to offer the best prices across the market. However, we are sorry you did not enjoy the massive discounts on your products. Best of luck, Josh
