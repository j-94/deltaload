Join 1000s building their apps with Databutton.

I've always had app concepts that I wasn't able to carry over the goal line. Databutton and the team behind it has been a boon.

I would say this is quite possibly the most non-developer enabled no-code builder I've ever come across.

Databutton is an incredible platform. I 100% couldn't build an application like this without it.

Databutton has broken a barrier for me. I can take all the thinking I've done and turn it into a real app within hours.

I'm not a programmer and I'm trying to build my own MVP. I had a "wow" moment with Databutton.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

#### Do I need to bring my own model/LLM key(s) to use Databutton?

No, not to use the Databutton AI app developer! We're always evaluating the best models available for the agentic framework you interact with in Databutton and associated costs are covered in your Databutton credit usage.

#### What if I want to make an AI-driven app?

If you want to build an app utilising a model or service (e.g. GPT-4, ElevenLabs, etc.), you will either need to bring your own API key/secrets for use in your application or request an API key/secrets from your application’s users.

#### Who owns my app’s code and IP?

You own your code and IP. Databutton is a facilitator in realising your big idea; we do not have any claim to your IP. We host your code on our service in order to make it easy to iterate, deploy, and provide a more on-rails experience.

#### How does deployment and hosting work?

We provide a 1-click deploy experience to \[username\].databutton.app/\[appname\]. We also support deployment to custom domains. We provide this for convenience and ease of use. If you want to deploy on your infrastructure, you can reach out to us.
