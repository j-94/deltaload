Deploy Command

Deploy Command
==============

![Image 3: Hero image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MightyMoud/sidekick/main/demo/imgs/deploy.png)

```bash
sidekick deploy
```

With your application deployed, it’s super simple to deploy a new version. This command will:

*   Make a new image of your application
*   Check for updates in your env file and if so, re-encrypt it and sync it to server
*   Deploy the new version without losing any traffic.

Input[](https://www.sidekickdeploy.com/docs/command/deploy/#input)
------------------------------------------------------------------

This command does not require any input. It will use the same app config that was saved in `sidekick.yml` file during running `launch` command.

Gotchas[](https://www.sidekickdeploy.com/docs/command/deploy/#gotchas)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Sidekick will check for updates in your env file and will re-encrypt its content if it has changed
*   Sidekick will save the docker image in a file and use `scp` to move that to your VPS then load it up. Make sure your VPS has enough space.

What does Sidekick do when I run this?[](https://www.sidekickdeploy.com/docs/command/deploy/#what-does-sidekick-do-when-i-run-this)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Build your docker image locally for linux
*   Compare your latest env file checksum for changes from last time you deployed your application.
*   If your env file has changed, sidekick will re-encrypt it and replace the encrypted.env file on your server.
*   Deploy the new version with zero downtime deploys so you don’t miss any traffic.
