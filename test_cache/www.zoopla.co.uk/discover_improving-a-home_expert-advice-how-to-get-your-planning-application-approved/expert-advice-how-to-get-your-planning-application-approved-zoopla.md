Planning permission.

If you do, there are a few ways to keep your planning application as smooth as possible and boost your chances of getting your application approved.

Without doing the necessary homework, some people find themselves in the difficult - and sometimes costly - situation of a refused planning application.

So we’ve brought in the experts from [home extension company Resi](https://resi.co.uk/?utm_source=partnership&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=zoopla_may_2023).

Their planning team has worked on more than 6,000 planning applications across England and Wales. They reveal their top tips for getting your application approved.

Here’s their advice for making sure your planning application goes through without a hitch.

[How can you make sure your planning permission application gets approved? -------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/discover/improving-a-home/expert-advice-how-to-get-your-planning-application-approved/#how-can-you-make-sure-your-planning-permission-application-gets-approved)“Local authorities make decisions on planning applications based on their adopted, and sometimes emerging, planning policy,” says Jordan Macann, Principal Planner at [Resi](https://resi.co.uk/?utm_source=partnership&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=zoopla_may_2023).

“This includes their Local Plan and Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs), which provide further guidance on how policies or proposals will be implemented.

“In order to give your application the best chance at being successful, your project should adhere to Local Plan policy and guidance within SPDs.”

“It can also be useful to request pre-application advice prior to the submission of a formal application.

“A planning officer will outline how they are likely to determine any subsequent planning application, and any changes that are needed to give your scheme the best chance of being granted permission.”

Joe Whitworth, Head of Technical Operations at Resi, adds that having a planning consultation can help your application get approved.

“The planning system in general still has its quirks and a large proportion of home improvement projects still need to go through the planning system.”

“Having a planning consultant provide advice to your architect, as well as manage the process gives you a massive leg up.”

[Check if your planning application will be approved ---------------------------------------------------](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/discover/improving-a-home/expert-advice-how-to-get-your-planning-application-approved/#check-if-your-planning-application-will-be-approved)Resi’s Home Improvement Report reveals which home extensions you’re likely to secure planning approval for and how much they'll cost.

[What are the most common reasons for planning permission being refused? -----------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/discover/improving-a-home/expert-advice-how-to-get-your-planning-application-approved/#what-are-the-most-common-reasons-for-planning-permission-being-refused)There are a number of reasons that planning permission can be refused. Knowing what they are and planning around them can help make sure your application is approved.

Joe talks us through some of the most common reasons planning applications are refused.

[How long does planning permission last?](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/discover/selling/how-long-does-planning-permission-last/)

### If your building plans impact your neighbours

“If your plans would reduce your neighbour’s privacy or overshadow a neighbour’s garden and cause a loss of light, then it may be difficult to get your application approved.

“Your council will assess the neighbourliness of your project including whether it will block out daylight, feel overbearing to your neighbours, or impact their privacy.

“That’s why speaking to your neighbours about your plans as soon as possible is always a good idea.”

### If the design is out of sync with your existing property

“It’s tough to get planning permission if your build’s appearance or design is out of character with the existing property.

“Be mindful to keep your design in line with the area and environment you live in.

“The size and scale of your extension, as well as the materials you want it to be constructed in are important to consider.”

### Risk of overdevelopment

“In urban areas and London in particular, property plot sizes tend to be smaller.

“It means that extending your home could significantly reduce the level of openness surrounding it.

“Planners may also request that your plans leave enough open garden space.”

### If your plans are likely to impact road access, safety or nature

“The council needs to take into account any impact your plans will have on the local area.

“This includes if they’re likely to restrict road access, impact safety and affect nature or biodiversity.

“Some trees are protected under a Tree Preservation Order, while the council will need to consider local wildlife habitats of bats and birds.

“If you live within a Green Belt - an area under a policy that prevents urban sprawl - they’ll also look at whether your build will impact this.

### If your property is a listed building

“It can be more difficult to get your planning application approved if your home is listed.

“Your plans will need to protect the listed features and character of the building.”

[How likely is it that your planning permission application will be approved? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/discover/improving-a-home/expert-advice-how-to-get-your-planning-application-approved/#how-likely-is-it-that-your-planning-permission-application-will-be-approved)The vast majority of planning permission applications across the UK are approved.

In the last quarter of 2022, more than 90% of planning applications were approved in 7 of the 10 regions in England.

The North East and South West had the highest approval rates (94%) while homeowners in London had the lowest approval rate (82%).

“This is likely to be down to London councils being more wary of overdevelopment,” says Joe.

“With smaller homes and plot sizes in London, there’s a greater risk of impacting open garden space or your neighbours’ properties.”

| Region | Percentage of planning applications approved in Q3 2022 | Percentage of planning applications approved in Q2 2022 | Percentage of planning applications approved in Q1 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| East Midlands | 92% | 93% | 93% |
| East of England | 89% | 89% | 88% |
| London | 82% | 83% | 82% |
| National Parks | 93% | 94% | 94% |
| North East | 94% | 95% | 94% |
| North West | 92% | 92% | 93% |
| South East | 91% | 91% | 91% |
| South West | 94% | 93% | 94% |
| West Midlands | 92% | 93% | 92% |
| Yorkshire and the Humber | 89% | 91% | 88% |

Planning Applications Statistics for England

This data comes from the Planning Applications Statistics for England. It does not include permitted development applications and only relates to alterations and enlargements to single dwelling houses, excluding flats.

[What complications could you come across in the planning application process? -----------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/discover/improving-a-home/expert-advice-how-to-get-your-planning-application-approved/#what-complications-could-you-come-across-in-the-planning-application-process)“Sometimes there are unforeseen complications in the planning process”, says Joe.

“A protected tree here, a flood risk there, a bat over there - the planning process will take all of these factors into account with your application.

“Where these issues crop up, they often cause complications in the planning process that are unforeseen.

“Fortunately they only occur in the minority of cases, but again these quirks of the planning system are why having a consultant and designers is so important.

“One of the biggest factors for planning being refused is ‘taking on too much risk’.

“Having aspiration and ambition is great, but there is an element of pragmatism needed when pursuing a home improvement project.

“Being tied up in the planning system for months is not fun, and it’s even less fun when you have to do it more than once because you want to pursue a dream idea that’s a little too ambitious.”

[What can slow down the planning permission process? ---------------------------------------------------](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/discover/improving-a-home/expert-advice-how-to-get-your-planning-application-approved/#what-can-slow-down-the-planning-permission-process)“Unfortunately, there is still a problem with resourcing and overly large caseloads in local councils, as well as this being exacerbated by an overall inefficient system”, says Jordan.

“This means you can still experience delays in planning and sometimes a lack of communication from planning officers.”

[Could not getting planning permission affect the sale of your home in future? -----------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/discover/improving-a-home/expert-advice-how-to-get-your-planning-application-approved/#could-not-getting-planning-permission-affect-the-sale-of-your-home-in-future)“Yes, extending your home without the right permission could affect your ability to sell your home,” says Jordan.

“When you come to sell, you need to provide documents that show any extensions or conversions were made with the necessary planning permission.

“So if you extend your home without the required permissions, you may be putting the buyer at risk.

“It could impact their chance of getting a mortgage and, once they own the property, they’ll be held accountable for any breach in the law during its construction.”
