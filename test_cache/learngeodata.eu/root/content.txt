He regularly hosts hackathons or gives scientific keynotes on 3D research conferences or other relevant industry topics. he gives online lectures at renowned universities regularly and proposes training bootcamps for industry professionals and large groups.

If you want to maximize the return on time invested, the shortest path is to get a direct and custom program & accompaniement that will unlock the desired set of skills.

Sometime, the best way toward your objective is to simply exchange with the people that already accomplished what you set yourself up to do. Cut to the essential, and avoid hours of searching the internet for vague answers.

Coaching, mentoring, teaching… The term points toward the same thing: Looking to have a trusted and close expert that give you a receipe for success. The next steps is to cook your desired outcome from it.

[Florent Poux](https://www.uliege.be/cms/c_9054334/en/directory?uid=u219618) has been at the forefront of automation in Reality Capture for more than 10 years. He holds an award-winning PhD in Sciences, and is recognized as an outstanding researcher through the [ISPRS Jack Dangermond 2019](https://www.geographie.uliege.be/cms/c_5724437/en/florent-poux-and-roland-billen-winners-of-the-2019-jack-dangermond-award) award. He bridges high-level research & knowledge transmission as an adjunct professor in 3D Geodata (University of Liege), a mentor in Data Sciences & Machine Learning (OpenClassrooms) as well as a [3D consultant](https://pointcloudproject.com/) (Geovast 3D).

Who is this 3D Academy for? 👨🏽‍💻
-----------------------------------

### Student 👩‍🎓

You are a student that wants to learn new skills, and/or you are right before an incredible job opportunity.  
Or you simply want to prepare for an internship, have a business impact and generate value for your team.

### Professional 🧑‍💼

You are a technician, an engineer, a developer or a manager, and you have industry experience and want to use this platform as a tool to extend your knowledge or train your team of engineers, and computer scientists on cutting-edge topics.

### Researcher 🧑‍🚀

You are inquisitive and want to use this platform to increase your knowledge in an area you love? You want to unlock new unexplored paths through a complete and unique deep understanding of the field with working solutions.

### Professor 🥷

You are a teacher, a training referee or a professor, and you want to refresh your course and expand your students reach with new cutting-edge skills by reusing code, tutorials, slides and more in your courses.

Who is the 3D Academy NOT for? ❌
--------------------------------

This academy is not for you if…

*   You are not willing to put in the time and effort to finish courses but just want to have the illusion you do something for your future self!
*   You are looking for a shortcut that will instantly make you an expert. No secret will make you an expert. Courses are curated knowledge that helps you and guides you towards a direction but can never make you an overnight expert!
*   You are looking for cheap courses that provide boring content, do not value quality, and do not incorporate different learning techniques!

The Academy guarantees that you will learn useful skills in AI, programming, engineering, or career development. Florent Poux has made many mistakes along his professional career path and had to make experiences the hard way. You can be sure that the courses will change your life and save precious time by not making the same mistake he made. Do not waste your hard-earned money on cheap courses that overpromise but underdeliver. Life is too short of making all the mistakes yourself!

Again, the objective of courses is to make it easier for you to maintain a level of consistency & save time. Yes, you can find everything online, but it does not guarantee that you are accountable and have curated knowledge in one place with high-level explanation and a love for technical details. If that is not what you are looking for but rather spend a few dollars on low-quality courses, then sorry for wasting your time reading this far, and we wish you the very best!

Regardless, feel free to email if you need help with anything or have suggestions on how the Academy can ramp up the production value & add more courses to the library!
