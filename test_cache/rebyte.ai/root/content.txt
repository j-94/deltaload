Goal
----

### Unlocking the Full Potential of LLMs with Your Data

### Fragmented and Inconsistent Data Sources

Applications often need to integrate data from various sources and extract only the relevant portions. Enterprises are generally resistant to changing how they store data, making it difficult to align these fragmented and inconsistent data systems with LLM requirements.

### Garbage in, garbage out

The quality of data to LLM directly impacts the performance of LLMs. Low-quality, unstructured, or poorly labeled data can lead to inaccurate, irrelevant, or even harmful model outputs.

### Data Exploration: A Specialized Expertise

Data exploration often becomes a specialized skill held by certain data scientists and programmers. This is because it requires a unique blend of data expertise and coding proficiency. Individuals with this combined skillset are often rare, leading to data exploration becoming the domain of a select few.
