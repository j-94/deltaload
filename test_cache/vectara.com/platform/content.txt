Go from wrestling with do-it-yourself components to rolling out your GenAI use case – Fast and (virtually) hallucination-free
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do-it-yourself RAG seemed promising until production. Now, you're stuck managing LLMs and databases, and manually chunking PDFs instead of solving the core problem.

> Vectara’s platform delivers conversational AI experiences that nearly always produce relevant, accurate responses. This team is on the cutting edge of developing responsible, highly valuable AI solutions. Their platform promises to mitigate LLM’s key shortcomings while broadening the range of potentially transformative use cases.

Best-in-class Retrieval
-----------------------

Vectara’s founders, early Google Research team members, built a world-class retrieval model.

### Advanced vector storage

Vector storage built on the principles of scalability, multi-tenancy, and high-performance.

### Smart hybrid search

Hybrid search combines semantic and keyword-based search for optimal results.

### Custom filters

You can apply filter expressions to further narrow down the searchable data set.

Deployment Options for Everyone
-------------------------------

Wherever you are, whatever your security, compliance, or privacy concerns, Vectara has a deployment option that will work for you.

Enterprise-grade Trust & Control
--------------------------------

A major concern with GenAI is its black-box nature, offering little to no customization. Vectara flips the script, providing granular control for greater accuracy.

### When ingesting data

*   Upload either raw data or files (PDF, PPT, etc)
*   Metadata Tagging
*   OCR, ASR (audio transcription)
*   Custom chunking

### When querying

*   Level of Hybrid search
*   Custom filters
*   Custom dimensions
*   Rerankers
*   Related content mode
*   LLM choice
*   Prompt Engine (LLM customization)
*   Access controls

Plus, Vectara never trains on your data, and encryption at rest and in transit ensures its protection. It’s also SOC 2 compliant, with more certifications on the way. Visit our [Trust page](https://trust.vectara.com/) to learn more
