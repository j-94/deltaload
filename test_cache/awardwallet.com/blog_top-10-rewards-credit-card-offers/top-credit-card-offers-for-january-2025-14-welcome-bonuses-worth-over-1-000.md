# Top Credit Card Offers for January 2025: 14 Welcome Bonuses Worth Over $1,000


The AwardWallet editorial team compiles the top rewards credit card offers each month. Here are the top offers to consider in January 2025.


## Content

Credit card welcome offers come and go. A card offering a large sign-up bonus one month may have a yawn-inducing bonus the next month. That's why the AwardWallet editorial team assembles the best credit card offers available each month.

As you'll see below, not all card offers are created equal. Simply listing 10 top card offers isn't practical. Many of the best card offers have massive spending requirements that not everyone can earn. And if you've applied for too many cards recently, you might be locked out of getting some other top offers. That's why we've broken down our list into three sections.

Here are the best rewards credit card offers available for January 2025.

Our Methodology
---------------

The welcome bonus — adjusted for the value of the points or miles — gets the most weight. To round out the list, we consider each card's long-term value, credit card application restrictions, and how much spending is required to capture the full bonus.

All the offers highlighted below offer a welcome **bonus worth more than $1,000** based on [recent AwardWallet redemption rates](https://awardwallet.com/blog/awardwallet-mile-valuations/).
