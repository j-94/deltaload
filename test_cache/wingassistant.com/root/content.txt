Don't Just Take Our Word For It
-------------------------------

Overall, I have been very pleased with each aspect of hiring my Wing VA. We were looking at a variety of virtual assistant programs; what made us choose Wing was the fact that their talent had specific marketing experience... Working with Wing is seamless. They have a robust platform that makes communicating with our VA incredibly easy. It also helps that they act quickly and are incredibly responsive...

Wing provides exceptional Virtual Assistant services and an accompanying productivity platform. Using Wing has been incredibly beneficial for our business, allowing us to explore some things in far more depth, or scale up some operations more effectively. Some of the benefits far exceed what you might expect from a virtual assistant in terms of capabilities and outside traditional administrative work.

I've had the best VA experience so far after multiple tries. The app is easy to use to communicate and create tasks, there's loads of real-person communication, and my assistant was so capable at MANY things. He was so good that every week I found more things I could take off my plate and all for a low fixed price per month. Great value and it's taken a lot of stress off me.

Frequently asked questions:
---------------------------

Is my Wing Assistant dedicated?

Yes, your Wing Assistant only works on your tasks during the agreed-upon hours.

What hours will my assistant work?

That's your choice! Wing Assistants work for clients worldwide - we can handle any timezone.

Can I access Wing Assistant worldwide?

You can access Wing Assistant anywhere in the world! Please note that Wing can only communicate with you and external parties in English (except for bilingual Assistants). Reach out to our sales team if you require an Assistant who can speak other languages.

What does “unlimited work” mean?

You can give as much work as you need to be done within the agreed-upon hours for the day. However, how fast your Assistant completes the tasks depends on several factors. These include the type of work, the complexity of the tasks, and how much other work your Assistant is doing for you.

Do you provide 24/7 coverage?

Although 24/7 coverage is available, we don’t offer it by default. Your Assistants are typically available 4 or 8 hours a day, five days a week. Clients choose the time bracket but can’t break up the hours; each Assistant must have an ongoing block of working hours. If you’d like to inquire about different coverage options (8/7, 16/5, 16/7, 24/5, 24/7), please reach out to us.

How do I communicate with Wing?

Wing has the following methods available:

Web app  
Slack integration  
Mobile app for iOS & Android  
Dedicated phone number (call & texts)

Email, WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams, or custom methods are available upon request.

Wing Assistants are based worldwide – they are typically college-educated, fluent English speakers who have undergone a rigorous vetting process and an in-depth training and testing program. All Assistants are supervised by talented Managers and have a team they can rely on for help. Our Assistants are compensated at higher-than-market salaries and incentivized by your happiness!

How long does it take to get replies?

Wing guarantees a reply time of 3 minutes. Within this time, your Assistant should be able to notify you when they’ll start working on your request or provide an update on their progress. How long the work itself takes depends on how complex the tasks are. Nevertheless, you can be sure your Assistant will do high-quality work. Wing Assistants undergo weeks of training, are highly educated, and speak English (mostly on top of at least another language).

Can Wing integrate with software I use?

Yes. Wing can use any software you use, e.g., Salesforce, Trello, Later, Hootsuite, etc.

How does customer support work?

Wing has excellent Customer Support, available round the clock on all plans. Wing guarantees a reply within one business day on any support matter, but you typically get a reply within a few hours. You can contact Wing Support via the web app or ask your Assistant to relay a concern, question, or item of feedback to Wing Support.

You also get a dedicated Client Success Manager who can help you with any aspect of the Wing experience.

Enterprise Priority Support is also available and guarantees a response time of 10 minutes within business hours.
