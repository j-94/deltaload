Course overview

### Effectively prompting and building with LLMs

**OVERVIEW OF THE COURSE**

LLMs (Large Language Models) show powerful capabilities, but not knowing how to effectively and efficiently use them often leads to reliability and performance issues. Prompt engineering helps to improve discover capabilities, improve reliability, reduce failure cases, and save on computing costs when building with LLMs.

This is a hands-on, technical course that teaches how to effectively build with LLMs. It covers the latest prompting techniques (e.g., fe-shot, chain-of-thought, RAG, prompt chaining) that you can apply to a variety of complex use cases such as building personalized chatbots, LLM-powered agents, prompt injection detectors, LLM-powered evaluators, and much more.

**_Topics include:_**

_• Taxonomy of Prompting Techniques_

_• Tactics to Improve Reliability_

_• Structuring Inputs and LLM Outputs_

_• Zero-shot/Few-shot/Many-Shot Prompting_

_• Chain of Thought Prompting_

_• Self-Reflection & Self-Consistency_

_• Meta Prompting & Automatic Prompt Engineering_

_• ReAcT Prompting Framework_

_• Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)_

_• Fine-Tuning LLMs_

_• Function Calling & Tool Usage_

_• LLM-Powered Agents (Agentic Workflows)_

_• LLM Evaluation & Judge LLMs_

_• AI Safety & Moderation Tools_

_• Adversarial Prompting (Jailbreaking and Prompt Injections)_

_• Common Real-World Use Cases of LLMs_

_• Overview of LLM Tools_

_... and much more_

**PREREQUISITES**

• This is a technical course and you need to be knowledgeable in Python to take this course.

• Basic knowledge of LLMs is beneficial but not required.

If you don't have experience using Python, we recommend our beginner's course: https://maven.com/dair-ai/llms-for-everyone

**ABOUT THE INSTRUCTOR**

Elvis, the instructor for this course, has vast experience doing research and building with LLMs and Generative AI. He is a co-creator of the Galactica LLM and author of the popular Prompt Engineering Guide. He has worked with world-class AI teams like Papers with Code, PyTorch, FAIR, Meta AI, Elastic, and many other AI startups.
