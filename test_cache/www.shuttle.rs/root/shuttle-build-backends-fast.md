How it works
------------

With Shuttle you can take any Rust service code, and have it ready for deployment by adding a single annotation to your main function.

Your code is packaged and sent to Shuttle where it is compiled and deployed. After a few seconds, your app is already running in the cloud.

You can then add more annotations that control cloud resources. Adding components like databases, secrets or storage is as easy as adding arguments to a function.

The next time you deploy your app, Shuttle provisions and configures the resources you need. In minutes, you can build complex and scalable apps on industry-standard AWS products and never have to touch the AWS console.

Deployed my second service with Shuttle and I really like it! It's fast and integrates well with cargo, so I can focus on the Rust code instead of the deployment. Well done!

Shuttle is hands down the best way to deploy a rust app quickly, safely, with the ability to scale. It has a variety of frameworks supported, and the community surrounding it is incredible. Heroku for Rust but better!

You soon realize Shuttle is much more than just a host for your app. It's your Rust framework for the cloud; Infrastructure as Crates! This puts Shuttle in front of everything else I've tried. I couldn't be more happy!

FAQ
---

### What happens when I deploy to Shuttle?

Your code is analyzed and built on our servers. The first time you introduce additional resources in your code, like the first time you use a database, we will add that resource to your project and wire it automatically to your deployment.

### Why should I use Rust?

We believe Rust is the language of the future because of the safety guarantees Rust provides and the efficiency of running Rust code. Also, with Rust you build once and everything just works - saving you tons of time on maintenance. And Shuttle makes the experience of building your backend with Rust better than anything you can find for any other language.

### Can I use any frontend framework with Shuttle?

Of course! When you deploy a project on Shuttle, your API becomes available at a URL of the form ${project\_name}.Shuttleapp.rs. And since Shuttle is compatible with any of the common frontend hosting solutions (Vercel, Netlify, etc), you just have to make your API calls to the URL of your project, and you’re up. Soon you’ll also be able to use Shuttle to deliver static content at the edge and host your preact or Next.js projects with the rest of your code on Shuttle.

### Is there a local development experience?

Absolutely. As a matter of fact, Shuttle makes sure that whatever you see in a local development environment works in exactly the same way when it gets deployed to our cloud. This includes all the resources you could end up needing, like databases and secrets for example.

### Do you plan to have a WASM runner?

We are putting a lot of effort into developing a WASM runner that plays well with other parts of a Shuttle project. We are very impressed by what we’re seeing so far in terms of improved build times and faster (we’re taking milliseconds…) deploy times. We’re expecting to roll out stable support for WASM services shortly.

### How does this differ from using serverless framework with Rust Lambda and provided runtime?

You can bring your lambda code to Shuttle as is. And we run it on dedicated infrastructure that keeps the state of your services across requests, has no cold-start and can even have long-running threads, all of which is not possible on AWS Lambda.

\n\nHow it works\n------------\n\nWith Shuttle you can take any Rust service code, and have it ready for deployment by adding a single annotation to your main function.\n\nYour code is packaged and sent to Shuttle where it is compiled and deployed. After a few seconds, your app is already running in the cloud.\n\nYou can then add more annotations that control cloud resources. Adding components like databases, secrets or storage is as easy as adding arguments to a function.\n\nThe next time you deploy your app, Shuttle provisions and configures the resources you need. In minutes, you can build complex and scalable apps on industry-standard AWS products and never have to touch the AWS console.\n\n*   Get Started\n*   Deploy\n*   Add a Database\n*   Deploy Again\n\n```rust\n1use rocket::{get, routes};\n2\n3#[get(\"/\")]\n4fn index() -> &'static str {\n5    \"Hello, world!\"\n6}\n7\n8#[shuttle_runtime::main]\n9async fn main() -> shuttle_rocket::ShuttleRocket {\n10    let rocket = rocket::build().mount(\"/\", routes![index]);\n11\n12    Ok(rocket.into())\n13}\n```\n\n![Image 113: bg mobile](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ftestimonials%2Fbg-m.png&w=750&q=75)![Image 114: bg](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ftestimonials%2Fbg.png&w=1200&q=75)![Image 115: stars](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ftestimonials%2Fstars-1.png&w=3840&q=75)![Image 116: stars 2](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ftestimonials%2Fstars-2.png&w=3840&q=75)![Image 117: comet 1](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ftestimonials%2Fcomet-1.png&w=3840&q=75)![Image 118: comet 2](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ftestimonials%2Fcomet-2.png&w=3840&q=75)![Image 119: comet 3](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ftestimonials%2Fcomet-3.png&w=3840&q=75)![Image 120: moon](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ftestimonials%2Fmoon.png&w=3840&q=75)![Image 121: earth](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ftestimonials%2Fearth.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nWhat the community says\n-----------------------\n\nJoin thousands of developers using Shuttle.

Together, we can create the future!\n\n[Github](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle)[Discord](https://discord.gg/shuttle)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/shuttle_dev)\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n### What happens when I deploy to Shuttle?\n\nYour code is analyzed and built on our servers. The first time you introduce additional resources in your code, like the first time you use a database, we will add that resource to your project and wire it automatically to your deployment.\n\n### Why should I use Rust?\n\nWe believe Rust is the language of the future because of the safety guarantees Rust provides and the efficiency of running Rust code. Also, with Rust you build once and everything just works - saving you tons of time on maintenance. And Shuttle makes the experience of building your backend with Rust better than anything you can find for any other language.\n\n### Can I use any frontend framework with Shuttle?\n\nOf course! When you deploy a project on Shuttle, your API becomes available at a URL of the form ${project\\_name}.Shuttleapp.rs. And since Shuttle is compatible with any of the common frontend hosting solutions (Vercel, Netlify, etc), you just have to make your API calls to the URL of your project, and you’re up. Soon you’ll also be able to use Shuttle to deliver static content at the edge and host your preact or Next.js projects with the rest of your code on Shuttle.\n\n### Is there a local development experience?\n\nAbsolutely. As a matter of fact, Shuttle makes sure that whatever you see in a local development environment works in exactly the same way when it gets deployed to our cloud. This includes all the resources you could end up needing, like databases and secrets for example.\n\n### Do you plan to have a WASM runner?\n\nWe are putting a lot of effort into developing a WASM runner that plays well with other parts of a Shuttle project. We are very impressed by what we’re seeing so far in terms of improved build times and faster (we’re taking milliseconds…) deploy times. We’re expecting to roll out stable support for WASM services shortly.\n\n### How does this differ from using serverless framework with Rust Lambda and provided runtime?\n\nYou can bring your lambda code to Shuttle as is. And we run it on dedicated infrastructure that keeps the state of your services across requests, has no cold-start and can even have long-running threads, all of which is not possible on AWS Lambda.\n\n![Image 134: stars](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ffrequently-asked-questions%2Fstars.png&w=3840&q=75)![Image 135: stars 2](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ffrequently-asked-questions%2Fstars-2.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Want to know more?\n\nJoin our Discord, we're happy to answer any questions!\n\n[Join Discord](https://discord.gg/shuttle)\n\nWhat’s new\n----------\n\nRead about Rust, Shuttle and development in general\n\n*   [![Image 136: article image](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2Fshuttle-web3-weavevm-thumb.png&w=3840&q=75) Supporting Web3: How WeaveVM Ships Rust Microservices with Shuttle ================================================================== Learn about how Shuttle can support Web3 related Rust web services off-chain. ![Image 137: undefined avatar](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Flogo.png&w=96&q=75) ### Shuttle 17 January 2025 •](https://www.shuttle.rs/blog/2025/01/17/shuttle-web3-weavevm)\n*   [![Image 138: article image](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2Fappeal-of-rust-thumb.png&w=3840&q=75) The Emotional Appeal of Rust ============================ What makes Rust emotionally appealing to its users? ![Image 139: Antithesis avatar](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Flogo.png&w=96&q=75) ### Antithesis 14 January 2025 •](https://www.shuttle.rs/blog/2025/01/14/the-appeal-of-rust)\n*   [![Image 140: article image](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2Farxiv-rig-rust-thumb.png&w=3840&q=75) Building an arXiv Agent with Rig & Rust ======================================= Learn about using the Rig LLM framework to be able to create AI agents for assisted research via arXiv. ![Image 141: Joshua Mo avatar](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fauthors%2Fjosh.jpg&w=96&q=75) ### Joshua Mo 8 January 2025 •](https://www.shuttle.rs/blog/2025/01/08/arxiv-rig-rust)\n\n[See all articles](https://www.shuttle.rs/blog/tags/all)\n\n![Image 142: rocket](https://www.shuttle.rs/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ffooter%2Frocket.gif&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Shuttle\n\n[Features](https://www.shuttle.rs/#features)[Starters](https://www.shuttle.rs/starters)[Status](https://status.shuttle.rs/)[Releases](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/releases)\n\n### Company\n\n[About](https://www.shuttle.rs/about)[Contact](https://www.shuttle.rs/contact)[Careers](https://www.shuttle.rs/about#careers)[Terms of Service](https://www.shuttle.rs/terms)[Privacy Policy](https://www.shuttle.rs/privacy)[Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.shuttle.rs/acceptable-use)[Cookie Policy](https://www.shuttle.rs/cookies)[Data Processing Addendum](https://www.shuttle.rs/dpa)\n\n### Developers\n\n[Docs](https://docs.shuttle.dev/)[Guides](https://docs.shuttle.dev/examples/axum)[Examples](https://docs.shuttle.dev/examples/axum)[Shuttle Heroes](https://www.shuttle.rs/shuttle-heroes)[Launchpad](https://www.shuttle.rs/launchpad)[Code Hunt](https://www.shuttle.rs/cch)[Shuttle AI](https://www.shuttle.rs/ai)\n\n### Community\n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle)[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/shuttle)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/shuttle_dev)[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/shuttle-yc)\n\n© 2024 Shuttle\n\nBacked by",
