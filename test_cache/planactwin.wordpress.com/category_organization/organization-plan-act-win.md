Reframing Your Day

Instead of feeling that you lost the day after a bad morning.

Reframe each day as 4 Quarters:  
\>\> Morning  
\>\> Midday  
\>\> Afternoon  
\>\> Evening

If you blow one quarter, just get back on track for the next one.

Fail small, not big!!!

If you want to reach a goal, you must see the reaching in your own mind before you actually arrive at your goal.

_Zig Ziglar_

| Be clear about what you want | Take some action every day | Believe your goal is achievable | Celebrate every small success | Write down what you want | Break your goal into small steps | Remind yourself of the benefits | Create a vision board | Create a plan of action | Focus on one goal at a time | Review your goals daily | Find a goal buddy |

The reason most people never reach their goals is that they don’t define them, learn about them, or even seriously consider them as believable or achievable. Winners can tell you where they are going, what they plan to do along the way, and who will be sharing the adventure with them.

_Denis Waitley_

Know what resources you have.. take inventory  
How much time do you have?  
How much money?  
What kinds of materials, supplies, or inventory?  
What are your other assets?  
Liabilities or obligations with task?  
Other people that can help?

Someone once told me that the bigger your life resource list is, then the greater your chances of bringing your goals to fruition.

To put it another way, life resource lists are like the lottery. The more entries you have the greater your chances of success, however, unless you cash-in your winning ticket, you will never reap the benefits. You must, therefore, make the most of the resources you have at your disposal at all times.

So the next time you are confronted with a large and seemingly insurmountable goal, simply turn to your life resource list for a solution, it may very well have the answers you are searching for.

Let’s first start with what personal development is. It’s a very broad subject. The process of improving oneself through such activities as enhancing skills, increasing consciousness and building wealth.  
They all seem to fall under five major categories.  
The categories are mental, social, spiritual, emotional, and physical.

1.  **Mental**  
    The first of the five areas of personal development is all about growing your mind. You can partake in many mental personal development activities.  
    Some examples are taking a class, reading a book, or watching an informational YouTube video to improve your skills. By setting aside some time each day, or each week, you can see growth in your career, increased productivity, and so much more.  
    
2.  **Social**  
    This category is all about improving your communication. In my opinion, this category is the most overlooked. However, social personal development is an important activity to practice.  
    Learning a new language, practicing your public speaking skills, and committing to doing more active listening are all activities that can help with social personal development.  
    When was the last time that you did any of these activities? If it has been a while I want to challenge you to pick at least one to do this week.  
    
3.  **Spiritual**  
    Spiritual personal development can mean something different for each person. The best way that I know how to describe it is anything that brings you peace and helps you connect to your true self.  
    The activities that fall under this category can be anything from spending time in prayer and reading your Bible, to taking a nature walk or meditating. For more examples check out this article.  
    
4.  **Emotional**  
    Emotional personal development can be, well, emotional. Because of this it can be easy to brush it off. I’ve done my share of doing this. I have realized that it wasn’t healthy behavior. The reality is that holding in your emotions, and brushing them off, only makes it worse when they finally do come out.  
    Some examples of what you can do here are journaling, tracking your mood, talking to a friend, or even a counselor.  
    
5.  **Physical**  
    Physical personal development is about a lot more than exercise.  
    You’ll also want to consider eating and sleeping habits, to name a few, to get the full picture of this category. Some activity examples include working out, getting 7-9 hours of sleep each night, meal prepping, and going to regular checkups at your doctor’s office.  
    By creating healthier habits around exercise, healthy eating, and sleep you will be on your way to be your best physical self.

One can compensate for the negative outcome of a recurring problem,  
but without repairing the errant process that caused it,  
the problem will undoubtedly occur again.

Sam Carpenter

In the pressure to get things done, many people fear being patient. They focus on short-term fixes to existing problems rather than on instituting processes to solve and eventually prevent problems and to identify unsuspected opportunities. But as in the fable of the tortoise and the hare, the people that seem to move most slowly and laboriously at the start often lead in productivity by the end of the day.

#### Clean up your Office

*   Does this item have a purpose?
    *   A three-hole punch obviously punches holes in paper, the important question is whether or not you actually need a big clunky device that punches holes in paper to get your work done.
*   Is this item redundant?
    *   If it is redundant, is its function so critical that you must have a backup immediately on hand?
*   Is it outdated?
    *   We know it’s hard to get rid of equipment you paid good money for, but unless you’ve got a real good reason to do so there isn’t any reason to keep old computer equipment around. We’re talking to you Mr. CRT-Stuffed-Behind-His-Desk-In-Case-the-LCD-Dies.
*   Are you keeping it, not because you currently need it, but because you might?
    *   In most cases the hassle of storing, cleaning, and maintaining an item for extended periods of time has a greater expense than finding that item should actually end up needing it in the future.
