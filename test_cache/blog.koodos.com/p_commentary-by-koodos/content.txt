to consume is to curate is to create.  
people are tastemakers.

the internet has become  
a firehose of content  
that doesn’t put out fires  
but fuels them.

and the friction that made it all mean something,  
the friction that forced us  
out of mindlessness  
and into awareness,

has been replaced by algorithms  
that can analyze current trends  
not emerging ones.

today’s efforts are working towards a future where  
all of the internet is  
an image of previous versions of itself.

we need machine and programmatic algorithms to scale  
but we need humans  
to make it real

and no medium has its meaning or existence alone,  
but only in constant interplay with other media.

we already experience the internet multiplanarily  
in our comments, reactions, retweets, memes, playlists, TikToks,  
but we continue to think fragmentarily and on a single plane.

our media  
are extensions of ourselves.  
so we’re extending it

with an expressive annotation layer,  
a creative plane  
to provide new  
opportunities,  
context,  
forms

where invisible creative labor  
rise as curators and  
are seen and celebrated.

but to elevate internet culture  
we must come to terms with its unpredictability.

youth are the purveyors of internet culture.  
so we ascribe a more intuitive valence to their judgements  
over those of technocrats and capitalists.

we’ve started with emojis.  
and music.  
on sms.  
for now.
