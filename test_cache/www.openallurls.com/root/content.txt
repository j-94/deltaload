Open Multiple URLs at Once
==========================

This free web tool allows you to open multiple URLs at the same time. It works by opening a new tab in your web browser for each URL you have typed in the following textarea. All major web browsers are supported, including Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome and Opera. If you open too many multiple links, your browser may freeze for a few seconds.

Insert multiple URLs (max 250)
