Making thought leadership at scale possible.
--------------------------------------------

**You know the value of thought leadership.**Leading organizations like Gong, VaynerMedia, y-combinator, Mindvalley and Refine Labs have demonstrated how significant of an impact running a successful thought leadership strategy can have across businesses.  
  
The strategy is simple - have multiple leaders in your organizations post consistently on channels where your target customers are - like LinkedIn or X - and you'll rapidly build influence and trust on these channels.  
  
**However getting everyone to post has been really hard.** People are busy with their tasks at hand, get stuck on what to write about, and simply don't have the time.  
  
Cleve makes this super easy.  
  
Each of your organization's thought leaders can **have their personal AI** that makes it easy for them to drop their rough thoughts throughout the day (even in just a voicenote).  
  
It then turns it into optimized content in seconds, in their tone.  
  
You can even add members from your copywriting, demand generation or comms teams, and have them access your thought leader's accounts to add final edits to the AI posts.

Man there aren't many products that excite me, I think the last one really was grammarly way back in the day. But the way this helped me **structure a post out of my shitty thought input** was perfect.

Cleve's **voice mode** is accurate & quite impressive, and I find the **questions it asks** to trigger you to think further and elaborate is much better than thinking alone.

I love the fact that I could **leave random notes** that i sometimes just have hanging around in my brain, and come back to it when I actually need to put out a post.  
  
**I also don’t feel like i’m working with an AI** because I dont need to generate prompts, Cleve kinda just understands the context and readily expands my notes as if I’m just finishing my own sentence.
