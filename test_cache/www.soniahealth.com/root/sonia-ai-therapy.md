Anyone
------

Mental health care should be available to anyone. Today therapy is inaccessible for a large part of the population. Costs, stigma and a global lack of mental health professionals prevent many people from receiving the care they need. Sonia will be available to anyone with an internet connection for 1% of today's costs.

Anywhere
--------

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 25% of people are affected by mental health disorders each year. In many areas of the world, therapists are overwhelmed or unaccessible. Sonia is accessible anywhere. Voice sessions from the comfort of your home, text session even in the bus.

Anytime
-------

Sometimes a crisis comes up at 2am, when most therapists are deep asleep. Sonia is here for you 24 hours per day, every single day. No more waiting several months for an appointent. Download the App and get started with you first session in less than three minutes.
