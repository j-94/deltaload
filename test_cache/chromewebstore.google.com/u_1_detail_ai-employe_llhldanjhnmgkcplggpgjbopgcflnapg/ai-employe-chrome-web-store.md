Overview


----------

First reliable AI browser automation powered by GPT-4 Vision.

AI employee is a straightforward, user-friendly AI-first RPA Chrome extension that functions as a virtual assistant directly within your internet browser. Our product, AI Employee, enables users to automate repetitive online tasks, much like teaching new interns to perform them. For instance, individuals working in supply chain management often find themselves manually copying details from purchase order PDFs to their company's ERP system—a tedious task. Once you demonstrate the process to the AI Employee and initiate it, the extension replicates the user's actions by extracting data points from the PDF and completing the form within the ERP system in one seamless sequence, controlling the browser.
