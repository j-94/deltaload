###### FAQ

### Frequently asked questions

What are the different license options?

A **fixed-seat** license is limited to one machine. To transfer it, use the Remove function in the General Settings menu.

A **floating license** can be used on multiple machines, as long as the number of opened Enscape windows does not exceed the number of licenses. An internet connection is required, but no additional manager. If there is no internet connection while you try to open Enscape, Enscape will start a 24 hour timeframe, counted on from the last successful validation. During this timeframe, you will be able to use Enscape as usual. If your computer still has no connection after 24 hours, or if your computer regains internet connection, but all of your seats are currently being used, Enscape will get watermarked.

Can I pay via invoice?

If you wish to pay manually via PayPal or bank transfer, please send us an email with the following information:

*   Company name
*   Contact name
*   Address
*   Email address
*   Type and quantity of license
*   VAT ID if applicable

Youâ€™ll receive the license key together with an invoice after accepting the offer.

Is there still a student license or academic license?

Click [here](https://enscape3d.com/educational-license/ "Ecucational Licenses") to read about our student license offer.

Does my version always stay up to date?

Youâ€™ll get a notification when starting Enscapeâ€™s host application if a new Enscape version is available for download. Therefore, you always have the newest version, independent of when you bought your license. There is no additional charge to update your version of Enscape.

How can I transfer my license to another machine?

You can revoke the license in the **General Settings** menu under the tab **Licensing**. After doing so, you can re-enter the key on another machine.

How can I manage/upgrade my licenses?

For floating licenses, you can use our [license center](https://enscape3d.com/community/blog/knowledgebase/license-center/ "License center"). This allows you to check your license count and renewal date. You can also change the amount of licenses.

For all other concerns, please send an email to licensing@enscape3d.com including your company name and the email address associated with your original purchase. Europeans should also include their VAT ID.

Why don't you offer one time payment?

Itâ€™s our philosophy to ensure the best experience to our users. Every few months, a new generation of GPU drivers, virtual reality headsets and CAD tool updates appears on the market. This requires a software to be continuously updated just to keep running. Instead of maintaining all outdated versions of Enscape, we decided to focus on improving Enscape to incorporate your wishes and ideas from our [forum](https://forum.enscape3d.com/ "Forum").

Subscription licenses are therefore the best way to ensure compatibility and a maximum speed of new improvements to your software.
