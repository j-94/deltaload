### Resolve reduces MTTR by 5x and increases on-call developer productivity by 75%

![Image 88](https://resolve-prod-strapi-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/why_us_1_bf3dc8749c.svg)

#### Increase Uptime

Automates root cause analysis and incident response, cutting Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) by up to 80%. With detailed incident summaries and hypotheses available before you log in, you'll experience faster response and significantly increased uptime.

![Image 89](https://resolve-prod-strapi-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/why_us_2_65f9ca5c0a.svg)

#### Reduce Alert Fatigue

Operates autonomously to handle common alerts and actions, reducing escalations and preventing burnout. Dynamically adjusts thresholds and dashboards to proactively prevent incidents and adjusts runbooks with every new incident. Saves up to 20 hours per on-call engineer per week so you can get back to building.

### TESTIMONIALS

Resolve is my go-to for investigating production issues. When an alert fires or a ticket comes in, it pulls together the critical data, saving me from sifting through overwhelming metrics. It analyzes everything upfront, so I can start solving the problem right away without digging through logs or dashboards across many tools.
