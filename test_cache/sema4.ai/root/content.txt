Putting agents to work

Putting agents to work
----------------------

##### Invoice reconciliation

_Challenge_: Manual invoice reconciliation consumes significant man-hours and reduces team productivity.

_Solution_: A finance agent automates the process, freeing up time for higher-value financial management tasks.

##### Regulatory compliance

_Challenge_: Compliance breaches can lead to costly penalties and damage your company’s reputation.

_Solution_: A compliance agent keeps enterprises up-to-date, generating reports on regulatory changes and forecasting potential impacts.

##### Receivables matching

_Challenge_: Manually processing remittance emails and matching payments to invoices is painstaking and error prone.

_Solution_: A remittance agent reduces manual processing by up to 90% and significantly improves accuracy.

At Sema4.ai, we believe agents will generate unprecedented productivity breakthroughs and forever change how work gets done. We empower business users to build and operate AI agents at scale, enabling them to see, act, and learn in ways previously unimaginable.
