We are drowning in a flood of information

The modern environment we live in makes us stressed, unhappy, and unproductive.  
  
Enter Capacities: your calm, safe, quiet space. Your Studio, your home for your best thinking.

Do you struggle organizing all your thoughts?
---------------------------------------------

It's time to change that.

Our computers made us think like them
-------------------------------------

We adapted our thinking and the way we work to computers; faceless files with cryptic names, sorted into unintuitive folders. This way of thinking holds us back. What if we told you there was a better, more natural way of interacting with your notes?

We're surrounded by Objects, let’s work with them instead
---------------------------------------------------------

Our units of thinking are made up of objects like books, people, conversations, or ideas. Say goodbye to files and hello to the intuitive world of objects. Your notes, reflected back to you in the way your brain works.

[Capacities is one of those apps that comes along every once in a while that completely re-wires your way of thinking and opens your eyes to new possibilities. * * * Rèka ![Image 29](https://capacities.io/testimonials/reka.jpeg)](https://medium.com/@rekawrites/my-pkm-routine-in-2024-1026f9fa75cb)

Folders and hierarchies limit our creativity
--------------------------------------------

They silo our thinking. They are too rigid to structure our dynamic, diverse, and interconnected work, thoughts, and experiences.

Break the silo, create a network of thoughts
--------------------------------------------

Connecting objects allows you to structure information in a more natural way.  
Objects reflect the world you see around you, and connecting them will help you make sense of complex topics.  
Working with objects might even spark new ideas where you don’t expect them.

[I've been using Capacities for the last few months and finally think I've found something that organises my signals in a way that works for me. * * * Steph Clarke ![Image 30](https://capacities.io/testimonials/steph.jpeg)](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7112786685846847489?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7112786685846847489%2C7117346922822070272%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287117346922822070272%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7112786685846847489%29)
