Adding cards to  
PILE
----------------------

### 1 - From inside PILE

![Image 26](https://pile.ie/assets/images/image05.jpg?v=be1a82d4)

Simply tap the + button on the top right corner of the screen and start adding Notes, Images (Photos), Attachments (PDFs, etc), Links or Folders.

### 2 - From outside PILE

Using the **Share Extension** simply share anything into PILE the same way you'd share anything to your friends:

![Image 27](https://pile.ie/assets/images/image06.jpg?v=be1a82d4)

### 3 - Using Finder or Files

PILE synchronises through **iCloud** and uses it's default file system, which means you can access, edit and add your PILE content from there directly.  
Simply go to **Finder from Mac**, then to iCloud Drive and there you will find a folder named PILE. Inside this folder you will find your Home and all the items that you have in your PILE._Make sure you use the same iCloud account in all the devices you want to access PILE information!_

![Image 28](https://pile.ie/assets/images/image08.jpg?v=be1a82d4)

The same applies to the **Files app** in your iPhone or iPad, you can access the same folder from there.

iCloud Synchronisation
----------------------

### How does it work?

![Image 29](https://pile.ie/assets/images/image11.png?v=be1a82d4)

[iCloud](https://support.apple.com/icloud) is the private cloud solution from Apple, and is enabled by default in any Apple device.  
PILE synchronizes through your iCloud, which uses your Apple ID account. PILE only has access to the data stored on the PILE folder in your iCloud.  
Any Apple device that has the same Apple ID will automatically synchronize the iCloud data by default. If they use a different Apple ID, PILE won't be able to synchronize.

### If it's NOT working do this:

1 - Make sure you are using the same Apple ID in all devices. [Sign In to your iCloud on any device](https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/icloud/mmfc0f1e2a/icloud).  
2 - Make sure you have enough storage in your iCloud. [Check your iCloud storage on any device](https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/icloud/mm039c13d410/icloud).Follow the example screenshots from iPhone Settings app:

![Image 30](https://pile.ie/assets/images/image09.jpg?v=be1a82d4)

3 - Make sure iCloud Drive is enabled on all your devices. [Enable iCloud Drive on any device](https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/icloud/mm203b05aec8/icloud).

![Image 31](https://pile.ie/assets/images/image10.jpg?v=be1a82d4)

4 - Make sure PILE has access to iCloud Drive enabled by tapping "Apps Synching to iCloud Drive" from above:

![Image 32](https://pile.ie/assets/images/image07.jpg?v=be1a82d4)

5 - Give some time to PILE & iCloud to synchronize, and make sure there is good internet. Specially the first time it synchronizes it might take some time.

If in your device you can see your PILE data in Files or Finder apps but not in the PILE app, please [contact me](https://pile.ie/#contact) because that might be a bug!

### PILE user account

PILE uses your Apple ID as your account.  
PILE has no access to your Apple ID email or data: PILE only has access to the data stored in its folder.  
This is why you don't need to login or give your email address while also we respect your privacy like no other.

Pile notes using Markdown
-------------------------

### What is 'Markdown'?

**Markdown** is a standarized way to type rich text format. PILE uses Markdown to format your notes. For example, if you want to add **bold** simply type \*\* text \*\* and it will make the text bold.  
Here is a list of what markdown styles PILE supports now:  
\- Bold: `**bold**`  
\- Italic: `*italic*`  
\- Link: `[Link](https://link.com)`  
\- List: `* list item`  
\- Title Header: `### Title`  
\- Subtitle: `# Subtitle`  
\- Line break: `\n`

### How can I use PILE notes?

![Image 34](https://pile.ie/assets/images/image13.png?v=be1a82d4)

Simply create a new note and start typing!All platforms have a menu on the bottom that easily adds styling for you.On iPhone you will be able to toggle between editing mode and viewing mode. When editing mode, you will see the markdown annotations, when viewing you will see the text without markdown but with the styles.On iPad and Mac you will see the split-screen view that allows to see directly how your text will look.

### Using a third-party editor on iOS or Mac

Since PILE uses iCloud Drive to synchronize between platforms and all your data is accessible through it, you can use a third-party app to access a note and edit it there directly.

Hello PILE
==========

### Pile app is closing down...

I decided to re-write Pile app because the underlying technology was not reliable enough. This sometimes gave bad experiences to users.  
By re-designing the app from the ground up, by ensuring thorough testing and a solid base and by using underlying technology more suited for this use case I ensure the next iteration is 100% reliable:

### PILE is the next version

PILE (all capitals) will replace Pile and it's been designed from the ground up to be 100% reliable, safe and private, while keeping the mission of Pile - to have a beautiful organised board of your stuff ready for you while keeping privacy on the forefront.

### PILE is better

PILE keeps your things in a folder structure that can be accessed and edited from outside the app. Open Files on iPhone or Finder on Mac and access the stuff you have inside PILE. Even from iCloud.com, making PILE useful in any platform.PILE notes use the standard Markdown, keeping it much easier to write rich notes.PILE stays private, focused and safe. Your data belongs to you. No ads, no data sharing, no AI training...

PILE uses Markdown to format your notes. For example, if you want to add **bold** simply type \\*\\* text \\*\\* and it will make the text bold.  \nHere is a list of what markdown styles PILE supports now:  \n\\- Bold: `**bold**`  \n\\- Italic: `*italic*`  \n\\- Link: `[Link](https://link.com)`  \n\\- List: `* list item`  \n\\- Title Header: `### Title`  \n\\- Subtitle: `# Subtitle`  \n\\- Line break: `\\n`\n\n### How can I use PILE notes?\n\n![Image 34](https://pile.ie/assets/images/image13.png?v=be1a82d4)\n\nSimply create a new note and start typing!All platforms have a menu on the bottom that easily adds styling for you.On iPhone you will be able to toggle between editing mode and viewing mode. When editing mode, you will see the markdown annotations, when viewing you will see the text without markdown but with the styles.On iPad and Mac you will see the split-screen view that allows to see directly how your text will look.\n\n### Using a third-party editor on iOS or Mac\n\nSince PILE uses iCloud Drive to synchronize between platforms and all your data is accessible through it, you can use a third-party app to access a note and edit it there directly.\n\n*   [Back](https://pile.ie/#faqs)\n\nHello PILE\n==========\n\n### Pile app is closing down...\n\nI decided to re-write Pile app because the underlying technology was not reliable enough.
