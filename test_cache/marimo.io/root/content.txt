Fit for the modern Pythonista
-----------------------------

marimo notebooks are reproducible, extremely interactive, designed for collaboration (git-friendly!), deployable as scripts or apps.

### Outputs update automatically

Run one cell and marimo reacts by automatically running affected cells, eliminating the error-prone chore of managing notebook state. Working with expensive notebooks? Just configure marimo to mark outputs as stale instead of autorunning.

marimo's reactive UI elements, like dataframe GUIs and plots, make working with data feel refreshingly fast, futuristic, and intuitive.

Rapidly experiment with code and models

Bind UI elements to Python values

Pick-up-and-play design, with depth for power users

![Image 79: exploring data in marimo](https://cms.marimo.io/landing/use-cases1.gif)

### Python-first design

marimo notebooks are pure Python and stored as .py files

Version with git, run as Python scripts, import symbols from a notebook into other notebooks or Python files, and lint or format with your favorite tools.

### Reproducible execution

Notebooks are executed in a deterministic order, with no hidden state — delete a cell and marimo deletes its variables while updating affected cells.

marimo can optionally [serialize package requirements in notebook files](https://marimo.io/blog/sandboxed-notebooks) and instantiate ephemeral virtual environments for them.

### Built for collaboration

Collaborate on notebooks with git: small changes yield small diffs. Goodbye JSON, hello Python!

Share results by exporting as HTML or serving your notebook as a web app with the marimo CLI.

### Made for developers

We care a lot about developer experience.

The marimo editor comes with GitHub Copilot, autocomplete, hover tooltips, vim keybindings, code formatting, debugging panels, and extensive hotkeys. marimo also ships with a CLI, a library, and a VS Code extension. Learn more at [our docs](https://docs.marimo.io/).

### Go from prototype to production

marimo makes it seamless to go from prototype to production.

Run as Python scripts, locally or in pipelines

Deploy as read-only web apps

> Marimo is amazing. I'm using it daily instead of Jupyter. Rather than writing throwaway notebooks, I have a big library of reusable Marimo mini apps.

> 😍 Saw the coolest demo of marimo tonight: an open-source developer environment that feels like a notebook -- but can be visualized as a web app, and under the hood is version-controllable (and deployable!) as a Python script.

Paige Bailey

> A really interesting new twist on Python notebooks. The most powerful feature is that these notebooks are reactive: if you change the value or code in a cell every other cell that depends on that value will update automatically
