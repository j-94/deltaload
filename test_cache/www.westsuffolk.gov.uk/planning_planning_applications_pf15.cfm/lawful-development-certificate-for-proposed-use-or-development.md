Lawful Development Certificate for Proposed Use or Development
==============================================================

An application for a Lawful Development Certificate for proposed use or development can be used to establish whether a proposed change of use or operational development would require planning permission.  
  
This is the only method to acquire a lawfully binding response as to whether a proposed development would require planning permission from the local authority.  
  
Further guidance can be found on the [Planning Portal - Lawful Development Certificate (LDC)](https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200126/applications/60/consent_types/9)

*   [Print](javascript:window.print())
*   [Expand all](javascript:void(0);)

*   [Application form (DC001)](javascript:void(0);)
    
    A completed form is always required (one copy of all application documents must be supplied if submitted by post).  
      
    You can [apply for planning permission online through the Planning Portal](https://www.planningportal.co.uk/applications)
    
    Please ensure that you have completed every section of the application form before submitting. Where sections or questions are not relevant please state this on the form.
    
*   [Fee (DC002)](javascript:void(0);)
    
    This is always required, except where the application:
    
    *   is for alterations, extensions and so on, to a dwelling house for the benefit of a registered disabled person (please provide evidence from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) that the applicant is registered as being disabled)
    *   is the first revision of an application for the development of the same character or description of the same site by the same applicant within 12 months of making the earlier application if withdrawn or the date of decision if granted or refused and **not** a duplicate application made by the same applicant within 28 days.
    
    Fees can be found on the [Planning Portal - a guide to the fees for planning applications in England](http://ecab.planningportal.co.uk/uploads/english_application_fees.pdf)  
      
    Further guidance can be found on [National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG) \- Fees for planning applications](http://planningguidance.communities.gov.uk/blog/guidance/fees-for-planning-applications/fees-for-planning-applications-overview/)
    
*   [Location plan (DC003)](javascript:void(0);)
    
    A location plan is always required and must be an up-to-date Ordnance Survey based location plan at an appropriate scale, usually 1:1250 or 1:2500. In the case of large sites other scales may be appropriate.  
      
    The plan must show:
    
    *   at least two named roads and all surrounding buildings or land (unless this would require a plan greater than a scale of 1:2500)
    *   the application site (the whole planning unit)
    *   a north point
    *   the scale clearly identified
    
    The plan used should:
    
    *   not be a Land Registry document
    *   show OS Crown copyright as an acknowledgement
    *   not to be copied from existing OS mapping, if using hand drawn maps such as standard streets
    *   show the correct licence number if you wish to print or copy maps for applications
    
    The application site boundary must be edged clearly with a red line. It should include all land necessary to carry out the proposed development - for example, land required for access to the site from a public highway, visibility splays, landscaping, car parking and open areas around the building.  
      
    A blue line should be drawn around any other land owned by the applicant, close to or adjoining the application site.  
      
    Site plans may be created through a number of online retailers. You can find guidance on the [Planning Portal - Maps plans and planning applications: what to submit](http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/uploads/1app/maps_plans_and_planning_apps.pdf)
    
*   [Relevant plans (DC006)](javascript:void(0);)
    
    Applications must be accompanied by plans and drawings or information necessary to describe the subject of the application including:
    
    *   existing and proposed block plans of the site (for example at a scale of 1:100 or 1:200) showing any site boundaries and neighbouring properties
    *   existing and proposed elevations (for example at a scale of 1:50 or 1:100). Drawings must show complete elevations, partial drawings are not acceptable
    *   existing and proposed floor plans (for example at a scale of 1:50 or 1:100). Drawings must show complete floor plans, partial drawings are not acceptable
    *   existing and proposed site sections and finished floor and site levels (for example at a scale of 1:50 or 1:100)
    *   existing and proposed roof plans (for example at a scale of 1:50 or 1:100) - required only for complex roof structures
    
*   [Planning statement (DC030)](javascript:void(0);)
    
    This is required for all applications where the context and justification for a proposed development needs to be demonstrated, and in particular all applications for major development, change of use and developments that do not accord with the development plan.
    
    A planning statement should:
    
    *   detail how the proposal has taken account of national and local planning policy
    *   identify the context for the development and why the site has been chosen
    *   detail the intensity and type of use and who the users would be
    *   detail any consultation that has taken place with the local authority, statutory consultees or wider public and the feedback from that consultation (where this has not been incorporated as a separate statement of community involvement)
    
    It may also include details of consultations with the local planning authority, the wider community and the statutory consultees that have been undertaken prior to submission of an application (a statement of community involvement may be incorporated into the planning statement where appropriate).
    
    Where proposals effect or create sports facilities and/or playing fields, or generate a substantial need for them, a planning statement should also include:
    
    *   reasoned justification as to why development affecting such facilities should be allowed
    *   details of the area of sports facilities to be lost and any replacement
    *   information on any assessment considered to support the view that the open space, sport and recreation facilities are surplus to requirements
    *   details of quality, accessibility, management and maintenance of proposed facilities and of existing facilities where there is a proposed loss
    *   details of existing and proposed changing/toilet facilities
    *   technical details including surfacing, fencing and floodlighting
    *   details of proposed sports to be played, including the level to be played at.
