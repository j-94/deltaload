> I've had my mind blown using Zed with Claude 3.5 Sonnet.I wrote up a few sentences around a research idea and Claude 3.5 Sonnet delivered a first pass in seconds. When I spotted some small mistakes, I highlighted the parts I wanted to change and shared feedback for it to fix. I was able to go from idea to running experiment code in half an hour—it was really easy and fun.

> My god it is so fast. Boot time, UI interaction, typing latency. I feel it. I knew VS Code always felt sluggish, but I didn't realize how good things could really be. I'm honestly astounded.
