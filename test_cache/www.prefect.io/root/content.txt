Discover Better Workflow Operations
-----------------------------------

Join us January 22-23 at Prefect's 2025 January Summit to discover the future of workflow orchestration. You'll learn how leading organizations are transforming their data operations by moving beyond task completion to drive real business impact.

“Airflow was no longer a viable option for Machine Learning workflows ... we needed an orchestration platform that offers a high level of data security and can be easily adopted by ML practitioners.”

“Prefect's compute model associates resources with jobs rather than environments, enabling us to run diverse workflows in a unified environment. The ability to separate code and infrastructure is extremely impressive - you can define everything in a single YAML file, making it easy to specify exactly which resources you need.”
