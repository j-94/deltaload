### OPTIMIZED ARCHITECTURE

Your design,  
optimized
------------------------

### ITERATE AT SPEED

10x  
exploration
-----------------

### FAST TRACK DECISIONS

Instant  
numbers
-----------------

### NO ENTRY BARRIERS

Seamless  
workflow
-------------------

### ReDEFINING ARCHITECTURE

Your design,  
optimized
------------------------

Finch utilizes AI, graph technology, and advanced algorithms to elevate and challenge your design work, taking it to the next level. It continuously enhances your input, allowing you to achieve the exact design you want – optimized.

### ITERATE AT SPEED

Explore faster, take designs further
------------------------------------

Generative tech enables rapid iterations, allowing you to explore a wide range of design options faster than ever before. Automatically fill stories and units with floor plans. Revise and refine your designs again and again.

### FAST TRACK DECISIONS

Instant numbers
---------------

Utilize the power of data to receive instant feedback on performance and guide design decisions. Streamline feedback loops and ensure informed choices, backed by numbers.

Break the right rules  

------------------------

Built in error prevention helps you stay within the right limits. You focus on the design and Finch stays in the background, making sure that your buildings are compliant with the rules of your firm, customer and municipality.

### NO ENTRY BARRIERS

Seamless workflow
-----------------

Revit, Rhino, Grasshopper and more— Finch easily integrates with your existing design and drafting tools, making it simple to incorporate into your current workflow.

For architects  
by architects
------------------------------

We love simplicity,  
beauty and functionality.  
The list when creating a tool  
for us was short and sweet:  
  
• Be simpler than pen and paper.  
• Use AI to assist and inspire.  
• Look great next to our designs.  
• Keep us in the flow.  
• Let us quickly change our minds.  
• Leave the fun things to us, the architects.
