How it works

Digitise, Analyse, Simplify
---------------------------

Sustainability data is scattered and complex to understand.

2050 Materials collects all product sustainability data to simplify decision making. The data enables everyone to **understand the performance** of each product as well as to find and compare alternatives.

We cover all carbon life-cycle stages, water, circularity, end-of-life, and available certifications.

Leverage our API for accurate data discovery.
