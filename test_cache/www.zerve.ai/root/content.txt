Language Interoperability

Zerve offers true language interoperability, meaning that as well as being able to use Python, R, SQL or Markdown all in the same canvas, users can connect these code blocks to each other.

![Image 98: Parallelization](https://www.zerve.ai/assets/parallelization.svg)

Parallelization

No more long running code blocks or containers, with Zerve enjoy unlimited parallelization at any stage of the development journey

![Image 100: Always In Sync](https://www.zerve.ai/assets/cloud-infrastructure-automation.svg)

Always In Sync

Analysis artifacts are automatically serialized, versioned, stored, and preserved for later use, meaning easily change a step in the data flow without needing to rerun any preceding steps

Compute Optimization

Fine-grained selection of compute resources – extra memory for complex data transformation spun up on demand only when needed.
