Status Quo

### Building a basic RAG pipeline is easy, but preprocessing unstructured data and always retrieving highly relevant results, takes effort.

Complex Data Cleaning

80% of enterprise data is unstructured in unusable format and difficult to clean.

Broken or Rigid Data Flow

Data flows for AI can be very complex, requiring rich integrations and and customized automation.

Hallucinations in answers

Stuck with LLMs that produce inaccurate, irrelevant or even fabricated answers.

Struggling to Scale

You're bogged down by infrastructure maintenance work that has little business impact.

Expensive

It's tough to control budgets and get quick results with complex AI systems.

Fragmented Tools

Your data, models, workflows and operations are fragmented across a galaxy of tools.
