Other platforms are stuck in 2015
---------------------------------

### Can't rearrange classes

You must do it perfectly right the first time.

### You get a class, you get a class!

### "Our CMS is the best"

That favorite tool of yours is not welcome.

### v2.13.please\_dont\_break

There is a new version of SEOify available. Update now.

The site is experiencing technical difficulties.

(This is fake)

### "We own your stuff"

Price is going up

Webstudio in the words of designers, developers, and startup founders
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The sites load blazingly fast - considerably faster than Webflow.

My mind is blown. It's like an open-source Webflow, but that truly only tries to be the frontend and lets other tried-and-true services power the backend.

Once you realize the power & potential Webstudio has to offer, you can see through the limitations of Framer and Webflow.
