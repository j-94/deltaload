    Backend Engineers, you will agree with me that building the authentication process for your app with each new API development is a pain. Here's my secret: I let [@appwrite](https://twitter.com/appwrite) handle my authentication process while I focus on the business logic.

    I have used Appwrite twice, and the experience of using it was great as I got to build a full-stack application. I would gladly recommend it to anyone looking to explore an alternative database option. Appwrite is simply the best.
