### Feature Flags for your Next.js applications

Create your first feature flag

#### Introducing HappyKit

Building applications with Next.js is fun.

If you've ever built something with Next.js you might have been blown away by its simplicity. I certainly was.

But as you get closer to release, something becomes apparent. There are questions you're not able to answer: How do you release a feature without redeploying? How can you hide a feature quickly in case something goes wrong? Which marketing copy converts better? Can you roll out a feature gradually?

Now the fun stops.

Next.js is great for building applications, but there's a whole piece missing as you get closer to production. HappyKit wants to be that piece.

Your companion to run Next.js in production — with confidence.

So the fun can continue.

Hi, I'm Dominik. While working with Next.js, I realized that Next.js is enabling a paradigm shift. The frontend and the backend are moving closer together. This unlocks a completely new category of tightly integrated services.

But existing tools haven't noticed.

They still live in a world where frontend and backend are miles apart. Segregated by location of execution.

So I set out to build drastically better tools. To take advantage of these new capabilities.

This journey has led me to create HappyKit Flags, a feature flagging service for your Next.js applications. Sign up below to get started for free. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do.
