API Specifications

Swagger places API specifications such as OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema at the core of its architecture, which are crucial for guiding teams through the entire lifecycle of API design and documentation. This strategic focus ensures that our suite, including open source tools and SwaggerHub, delivers unparalleled efficiency and a seamless user experience.

[Explore the API Specifications](https://swagger.io/resources/open-api/)
