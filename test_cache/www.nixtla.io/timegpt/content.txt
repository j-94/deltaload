TimeGPT democratizes access to cutting-edge predictive insights, eliminating the need for a dedicated team of machine learning engineers.

Free plan available. No credit card required.[](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/)

Simple and Fast

Just upload and predict one or millions of series in seconds. No training required.

Disruptive

TimeGPT was trained on the largest data collection in history – over 100 billion data points of financial, weather, energy, web data, among other sources. Democratizes the power of time-series analysis making it accessible to everyone through a simple API call.

Flexible

TimeGPT can be fine-tuned on your own data to make more informed strategic decisions and adapt to your particular domain.

Features

Easy to use.  
Extremely effective.
-----------------------------------

### Forecasting

Harness the power of a specialized transformer-based architecture designed explicitly for time series data, ready in just two lines of code. Boost accuracy with domain-specific fine-tuning and amplify forecasts with exogenous factors. Capture complex signals with unparalleled precision.

Good For:

Incorporating Exogenous Factors

Hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly data timeframes.

### Anomaly Detection

Use TimeGPT to identify the unseen and the unexpected, recognize deviations and outliers that may signify deeper underlying issues or opportunities. Its precision and well-calibrated uncertainty estimations based on conformal prediction make it an invaluable tool in diverse scenarios.

Good For:

Recognizing Complex Patterns

Domain-Specific Scenarios
