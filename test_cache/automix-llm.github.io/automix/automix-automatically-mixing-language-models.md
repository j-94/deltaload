TLDR: AutoMix optimizes cost and accuracy by routing queries between small and large language models,  
through self-verification and POMDP routing.

Abstract
--------

Large language models (LLMs) are now available from cloud API providers in various sizes and configurations. While this diversity offers a broad spectrum of choices, effectively leveraging the options to optimize computational cost and performance remains challenging. In this work, we present **AutoMix**, an approach that strategically routes queries to larger LMs, based on the approximate correctness of outputs from a smaller LM. Central to AutoMix are two key technical contributions. First, it has a few-shot _self-verification_ mechanism, which estimates the reliability of its own outputs without requiring extensive training. Second, given that self-verification can be noisy, it employs a _POMDP-based router_ that effectively selects an appropriately sized model based on answer confidence. Experiments across five language models and five challenging datasets show that AutoMix consistently surpasses strong baselines, reducing computational cost by over _50%_ for comparable performance.

Key-Highlights
--------------

*   üîÅ **Few-shot Self-Verification:** Accurately assess correctness using just the context, without extensive training.
*   üí° **POMDP-based Router:** Overcome noisy verification signals and dynamically select from multiple models.
*   üìà **Efficiency Gains:** Achieve over 50% reduction in computational cost at similar performance.
*   üîå **Black-box Applicability:** Works out-of-the-box with closed-source APIs, no access to weights required.

Results Summary
---------------

**AutoMix consistently outperforms strong baselines, providing a better incremental benefit per cost (IBC) and reducing computational cost by over 50% while maintaining comparable performance.**

Using AutoMix in your code
--------------------------

Using AutoMix in your code takes only a few lines of changes.

**1\. Installing**

```
pip install automix-llm
```

**2\. Training and Inference**

```
from automix import Automix, POMDP

mixer = Automix(POMDP(*args, **kwargs))
mixer.train(train_data)
results = mixer.evaluate(test_data)
```

**3\. High Customizability**
