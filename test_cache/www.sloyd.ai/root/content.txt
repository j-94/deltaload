Yes, you can! Our Text to 3D Model AI Generator specializes in converting text prompts into detailed 3D models. Currently, it supports a range of categories including buildings, props, weapons, and certain types of vehicles. We leverage advanced AI-driven generators, based on object archetypes, to ensure the creation of game-ready assets. These generators are adept at producing a wide array of variations from each archetype, meeting most of your design needs efficiently.

While the field of pure generative AI for 3D modeling is still evolving, our approach combines emerging AI technologies with advanced parametric generators. The rapid advancements in generative 2D art are inspiring, but 3D assets, particularly for gaming, require high optimization and precise topology. Currently, a comprehensive and sufficient training dataset for fully generative 3D AI doesn't exist. Also, diffusion models and NeRFs doesn’t supply the optimized mesh game developers need.

To bridge this gap, we're creating a unique dataset through our parametric generators, and using AI to influence the look of models. This innovative combination allows us to generate everything in real-time with game-ready results, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in 3D AI modeling.

Our tool is built around a powerful parametric engine that can generate millions of unique assets in real-time. This exceptional speed enables the creation of fully unique assets directly within games. Additionally, it powers a responsive and easy-to-use web editor, which runs smoothly in your browser. Ideal for game developers and 3D artists, our generator offers the efficiency and flexibility needed to produce diverse and creative 3D models quickly and effortlessly.

Absolutely! Sloyd offers a free online 3D modeling experience. Utilize our Sloyd web app to effortlessly create 3D models directly in your browser. With no downloads required, you can immediately start crafting models using our extensive range of templates and AI prompting. Whether you're a professional or a hobbyist, our tool simplifies 3D modeling online, making it accessible and convenient for everyone.

Definitely! Sloyd is your go-to free 3D AI generator. Our platform offers a range of downloadable 3D models at no cost. Simply visit our [web app](https://app.sloyd.ai/), start customizing your models to your preference, and download them for your use. Sloyd makes 3D model generation accessible, easy, and with free downloads each month, helping you bring your creative ideas to life without any financial barriers.

Our tool offers a wide spectrum of 3D modeling possibilities. You can create everything from architectural structures and furniture designs to weapons, and props. Whether you're looking to design realistic environments, stylized buildings, or abstract concepts, our tool provides the necessary features and flexibility. With a focus on user-friendly interfaces and advanced customization options, our tool is ideal for both professional designers and hobbyists looking to bring their unique visions to life in the 3D space.

Currently, our 3D generator specializes in text-to-3D model creation. It is designed to transform textual descriptions into 3D models. As of now, it does not support the conversion of images into 3D models. Our tool excels in interpreting and visualizing text inputs, allowing users to generate a wide range of 3D models based on written descriptions. This feature is particularly beneficial for users who want to quickly and efficiently bring textual concepts to life in a three-dimensional form. However, this feature is still in beta, so some responses might not be perfect! We constantly improve our AI algorithms, so check back for updates.

When you prompt, our AI pulls from our extensive library of parametric 3D model parts, and assembles them into an object that matches your prompt. This way we make sure the topology is optimized, and that 3D model generation can happen in seconds or milliseconds, and not minutes and hours.

Parts and generators are made by our community and our team of 3D artists. We have made a tool, the Sloyd Maker, to create these in a way where parts are reusable, so if you are building a new object that needs for example a handle, a scope, or a hinge, chances are you can use an existing generator. This way, our generators can create so many variations that its very hard to get exactly the same result as someone else.

The pilot for the Sloyd Maker has ended. We are making some improvements and are planning an open alpha soon. If you are interested, shoot us an [email](mailto:hello@sloyd.ai?subject=Access%20to%20Sloyd%20Maker%3F), or [join our Discord.](https://discord.gg/Snx3yxfZUr)
