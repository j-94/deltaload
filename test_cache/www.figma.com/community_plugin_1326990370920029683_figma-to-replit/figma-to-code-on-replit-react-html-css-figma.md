Design in Figma, Prototype in Replit
------------------------------------

This experimental plugin turns static designs into responsive React components. Export the generated code to Replit to share an instantly-deployable React app with your team, for rapid prototyping with real logic and data.

[**Got feedback? We'd love to hear from you**](https://replit.typeform.com/to/xRpxJcnb#username=xxxxx)

**How it works:**

1.  **Design a component or page**. Use best practices for layer naming, auto-layout and wrapping, and shared styles, to prepare your design for export.
2.  **Run this plugin**. You can run it in Design Mode or Dev Mode.
3.  **Select a layer and click "Generate code"**. This will generate a React component and CSS module for your selection, along with some basic React template files.
4.  **Copy code or create a Repl**. You can select a file to copy its contents to your clipboard, or generate a working React Repl by exporting to Replit. **Select the Node.js template when asked to choose.**
5.  **Prototype or polish.** Wire the generated code up to real data for user testing or rapid prototyping, or polish the output for use in production.
6.  **Deploy and share**. Deploy your new Repl to get a shareable URL to your component or page.

**Additional features:**

*   Export vector layers as React SVG components (optional)
*   Automatically infers responsive properties even without autolayout
*   Choose between exporting CSS modules or inline styles
*   Generate Google Fonts CSS import statements
*   Export Figma Node IDs as HTML Attributes and CSS comments (optional) to tie your code back to Figma

**What isn't supported?**

Currently a few Figma features are unsupported in code generation:

*   Semantic HTML tags (everything is a div, span, or svg)
*   Image fills and images will not be exported
*   Syncing generated code into an existing project/Repl
*   Gradients and shadows
*   Variables
*   Variants
*   Hidden layers (they will be ignored)

**Pro tips:**

When you're ready to export, make sure you are following these best practices to generate the most accurate export:

*   Apply auto-layout, including wrapping, spacing, and constraints, to all layers.
*   Convert groups to frames. Groups will be exported as SVGs.
*   Flatten vector layers or create a single group with all the parts and no nested groups
*   Name your layers something that will be meaningful to a developer, for example a component name (IconButton) or a semantic class (button)
*   Minimize the number of nested frames as much as possible, so your layout is controlled by as few frames as possible

**Caveats and future plans:**

*   The plugin currently attempts to infer auto-layout properties even when they are not specified for a layer. This isn't always perfect.
*   The plugin does not support Figma prototype behaviors like links and transitions. Functionality can be added in code via the Replit code editor and Replit AI coding assistant.
*   Instances are poorly supported and don't always work. It's best to detach all nested instances before exporting.

Version 39 on March 4, 2024Removes auto-generated align-self CSS attributes to better export center-aligned autolayout frames with children set to "stretch".

Version 38 on February 20, 2024Adds instrumentation for event tracking
