## Content

Paste into Webflow or the Relume Figma Plugin to add Wireframes

* * *

Hello, my sitemap export did not work on Figma? Please help me out. Thanks.

* * *

[Franc](https://www.figma.com/@franc1)@franc1 · 1 month ago

Nope. Tried several times to use the plugin to no avail.

* * *

[Daniel](https://www.figma.com/@danielprecious)@danielprecious · 1 month ago

I'm stick here please

* * *

For those who's using this tool for first time: BEFORE INTSALLING, save their design system as a pop up suggest. Create a new page. Then: A) You need to find and install this plugin from the FIGMA MENU. B) Once installed, run it. C) Link your RELUME account, having their Kit opend.

* * *

can you just drop the link to download the plug in here please in the comments...

* * *

It stopped working. I just became a subscriber and it's broken. When trying to login through the plugin, the browser opens and nothing happens.

* * *

Doesnt work ! can export from relume, it ask me to install the plugin, i did it, and nothing happend, Maybe i'm a silly boy ? S.O.S please someone help me !

* * *

For everyone who is struggling: please go to figma Click left top Plugins Run Last plugins and it should ask to connect! Goog luck

* * *

I can't export from Figma. It says "An error occur" Please share what I can do to fix it. Thanks

* * *

nice tool (dis actually a real comment

* * *

The plugin isnt working whats going on?

* * *

I really starting to hate this, why isnt possible to just export the facking Relume to Figma. This workaround is such a bullshit

* * *

this shi aint working bru

* * *

I'm having some issues with the Relume to Figma process. Typcially I hit "run" and it builds it all in Figma but it's not working now. Is there anything I can to do troubleshoot?

* * *

This is an incredible tool! thank you

* * *

I get no sitemaps, only wire when I export and I am not able to reload and get the changes I made in Relume into the wireframes in Figma?

* * *

This does not work...I can't export the wireframe to Figma...

* * *

same issue, can't export to figma.

* * *

I don't understand why when i export wireframes, they don't paste on Figma originally like on Relume?

* * *

It doensn't work for me either - I can't export the sitemap into Figma. It keeps asking me to install the plugin then the file on figma is empty

* * *

same bug happening to me. Open In\>Untitled and new tab open then below error is displaying. Uh oh… we can't open that file We can't open this file because WebGL isn't supported, or is disabled, in your browser. If your browser supports WebGL, check out [this help article](https://help.figma.com/hc/articles/360039828614) to find out how to enable it. Got it

* * *

Hi there, after adding the Relume Figma Plugin it asks me to open in 'Figma Basics' or 'Free - Relume Figma Kit'. Which one should I use and how do I know if it worked?

* * *

I'm also experiencing the same issue.

* * *

It keeps taking me back to install plugins, in which I have installed already. I am stuck, I thought after exporting I'll be able to use the wireframes generated for me?

* * *

waaaay to expensive. even chat gpt and AI video generating AIs are less expensive than this.. would max pay 10 bucks a month

* * *

Thanks gays its look amazing as an startup

* * *

I added Relume Plugin for Figma. I added the Figma Kit (Free) and then uploaded the wireframe using the Relume Plugin. I edit the buttons on the Style Guide but it doesn't change on the WireFrame. I have tried several times without success. Is there a better video explaining the steps? Does it not work on the (Free) kit?

* * *

After upgrading to pro it works

* * *

Hi, I managed to install plugin - but I logged in to Figma first, then I clicked "Open in..." button (here in Relume plugin community page)and chose "untitled" project. A window opened of Figma and in Figma it showed me the windown to install Relume plug in directly. But if doesn't take you to this section automatically, try going to this section with icons in Figma menu (on the right of big "T" letter in FIgma menu), then search for "relume" plugin. I have a free account in Relume, so I saw the button "Add wireframe" disabled and the info "Upgrade your plan to import wireframes", but it's good to know that it's possible to add this plugin to Figma. Need to upgrade the account .. :( PS I used Google CHrome to do all of this, maybe there is some blocker in Edge or other browsers. I don't have ad blocker etc in Chrome.

* * *

Same problem here.. loop.

* * *

Yah i'm stuck in the loop too this is ridiculous and was a complete waste if my precious time.

[Relume](https://www.figma.com/@relume)@relumeCreator · 1 year ago

Hi [@mciahanderson](https://www.figma.com/@mciahanderson)! Can you send a ticket to support@relume.io with more info? We've investigated this bug and seems to be working.

* * *

Same here just goes in a loop - Doesn't work for me... keep returning me to install plugin that is already there....

[Relume](https://www.figma.com/@relume)@relumeCreator · 1 year ago

Hi [@samhassen](https://www.figma.com/@samhassen)! Can you send a ticket to support@relume.io with more info? We've investigated this bug and seems to be working.

* * *

Where is the detached option?

* * *

watched many videos. seems easy to go relume-\>figma-\>webflow. but I cant seem to get my wireframe into figma with the style guide attached to it

* * *

I can't open Figma kit in Figma. I have Relume pro. What should I do?

* * *

How can ı export tablet and mobile version in Figma?

* * *

[Admin](https://www.figma.com/@admin46)@admin46 · 1 year ago

Can't properly export wireframe to figma. most sections are empty

* * *

I love it! It works super smoothly and reduces the time to set up the first and second drafts for team discussion! (Unfortunately, we have a lot of internal edits and changes, so I did not get a chance to convert from Figma to Webflow. However, I am excited to try it out once I have more time to explore)

* * *

Works seamlessly! Love using it and saves so much time!

* * *

AI wireframe generator is AMAZING. Makes my least favourite part of the process way more enjoyable
