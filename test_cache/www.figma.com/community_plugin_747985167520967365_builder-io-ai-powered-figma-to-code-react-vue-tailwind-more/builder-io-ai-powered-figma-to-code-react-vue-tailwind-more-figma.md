Use AI to generate clean, responsive code from Figma designs in real-time.

1.  **No setup**: No need to do anything special to your design files before you turn them into code
2.  **Any framework:** Generate React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Swift, Flutter, Kotlin, React Native, HTML and more. Choose your preferred styling library, whether it's Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, Emotion, Styled Components, or Styled JSX
3.  **Automatically responsive:** Generated code is automatically responsive, even when your designs don’t use auto layout
4.  **Leverage existing components:** Map Figma components to code components to reuse existing components during code generation.
5.  **Easy to read, improve, and export code:** Generated code is clean code and developer-friendly so it’s easy to read, edit, update, and integrate it with your existing JavaScript and HTML code for web pages and apps

The design export from builder-figma plugin to builder visual editor was quite accurate. However, there tutorial was confusing to me, it took some time poking around to figure out how. First thing foremost, you need to click on export to builder on the Figma plugin (which wasn't highlighted). Second, make sure you selected designer mode in [builder.io](http://builder.io/) (If developer mode, you don't see the visual builder)

[Greg Smith](https://www.figma.com/@gregsmith3)@gregsmith3 · 21 days ago

This product is a HUGE disappointment. It pretends to generate code to run on the web, but lacks the guts to preview it inside the app. I would consider running a new project from this if I could see it work, but I am NOT going to build a project, find somewhere to host it, and then hold [Builder.io](http://builder.io/)'s hand while it stumbles through attempts to replicate the Figma design. Just show me SOMETHING... Otherwise, I'll just go back to my existing 100-file project and use ChatGPT to help me update it to the new design. Having a product that runs in the browser and is supposed to be able to write code for browsers is really intriguing... But not being able to run the generated code in your own ecosystem is unforgivable. Shame on you.

[Ed](https://www.figma.com/@ed97)@ed97 · 2 months ago

It advertises that you can export your Figma designs into Builder, and then into code. And yet I don't see a clear way to do that. After I export it to builder, I have no option to export it to code, as in the screenshots or videos. The design is simply imported into [Builder.io](http://builder.io/)'s dashboard, which also generates a mobile version of it, but the top bar with the icon to export to code isn't there. I've been at this for an hour. UPDATE: I followed Steve's advice and exporting the code worked now. Thank you for chiming in, Steve!

[Kathy Hurchla](https://www.figma.com/@kathyhurchla)@kathyhurchla · 10 months ago

I've used the plugin successfully in developing functional proofs-of-concept quickly. I wish Figma did not require “can edit” access to a board in order to simply run a plugin, since my objective sometimes is only one way and I don't need to edit the source designs or prototypes in Figma and the licensing costs are high for roles just looking to run a plugin. That or be more liberal with what's allowed with Figma API access outside of its plugin API. On the [Builder.io](http://builder.io/) side though, it's a promising solution making the most of what's accessible. Thank you!

* * *

[Elyse Hunt](https://www.figma.com/@elysehunt)@elysehunt · 11 months ago

This plugin has come a long way since its beginnings. The import is almost perfect at this point. It still requires some tweaking once in Builder, but it saves time getting it there. The real star is the AI code editor which saves massive amounts of times and works shockingly well!

* * *

[Stephanie Kwon](https://www.figma.com/@stephaniekwon)@stephaniekwon · 11 months ago

love the AI import from figma! it's not perfect yet but a big step forward. What I love about is that I can import and at least learn how to make an asset rather than leaving this all through trial and error. This has saved me a lot of time and decreased my workload when it comes to building new assets!

[patrick oleary](https://www.figma.com/@patrickoleary3)@patrickoleary3 · 1 year ago

Totally new to this, combining it with other tools to get some good landing pages. It works, but not the easiest to navigate and with one page it started prompting me to upgrade my account. Which I get, but I spent a couple of minutes trying to figure out how do I export the code and images, and not just a codepen. So provide a cleaner intuitive way to get things out and more than happy to sign up.

However, there tutorial was confusing to me, it took some time poking around to figure out how. First thing foremost, you need to click on export to builder on the Figma plugin (which wasn't highlighted). Second, make sure you selected designer mode in [builder.io](http://builder.io/) (If developer mode, you don't see the visual builder)\n\n* * *\n\n[Greg Smith](https://www.figma.com/@gregsmith3)@gregsmith3 · 21 days ago\n\nThis product is a HUGE disappointment. It pretends to generate code to run on the web, but lacks the guts to preview it inside the app. I would consider running a new project from this if I could see it work, but I am NOT going to build a project, find somewhere to host it, and then hold [Builder.io](http://builder.io/)'s hand while it stumbles through attempts to replicate the Figma design. Just show me SOMETHING... Otherwise, I'll just go back to my existing 100-file project and use ChatGPT to help me update it to the new design. Having a product that runs in the browser and is supposed to be able to write code for browsers is really intriguing... But not being able to run the generated code in your own ecosystem is unforgivable.

And yet I don't see a clear way to do that. After I export it to builder, I have no option to export it to code, as in the screenshots or videos. The design is simply imported into [Builder.io](http://builder.io/)'s dashboard, which also generates a mobile version of it, but the top bar with the icon to export to code isn't there. I've been at this for an hour. UPDATE: I followed Steve's advice and exporting the code worked now.

The generated code is not perfect but saves a lot of time during development.\n\n* * *\n\n[Agam Singh](https://www.figma.com/@agamsingh1)@agamsingh1 · 9 months ago\n\nReally good plugin, used a few different but nothing comes close to this. saves 60% of the time\n\n* * *\n\n[Sagar Vavadiya](https://www.figma.com/@sagarvavadiya)@sagarvavadiya · 10 months ago\n\nthis usefull to reduce 50% work of frontend design.\n\n* * *\n\n[Jen](https://www.figma.com/@jen73)@jen73 · 10 months ago\n\nI used this a while ago to convert a webpages to figma. Is that still an option? If yes, how do I do it? Things have changed since the last time I used this plugin. These were the original instructions but it appears that things have changed. [https://github.com/BuilderIO/figma-html/blob/master/chrome-extension/README.md](https://github.com/BuilderIO/figma-html/blob/master/chrome-extension/README.md)\n\n* * *\n\n[Jackson Kasi](https://www.figma.com/@jacksonkasi1)@jacksonkasi1 · 10 months ago\n\nit's awesome🔥\n\n* * *\n\n[Kathy Hurchla](https://www.figma.com/@kathyhurchla)@kathyhurchla · 10 months ago\n\nI've used the plugin successfully in developing functional proofs-of-concept quickly. I wish Figma did not require “can edit” access to a board in order to simply run a plugin, since my objective sometimes is only one way and I don't need to edit the source designs or prototypes in Figma and the licensing costs are high for roles just looking to run a plugin. That or be more liberal with what's allowed with Figma API access outside of its plugin API. On the [Builder.io](http://builder.io/) side though, it's a promising solution making the most of what's accessible. Thank you!\n\n* * *\n\n[Elyse Hunt](https://www.figma.com/@elysehunt)@elysehunt · 11 months ago\n\nThis plugin has come a long way since its beginnings. The import is almost perfect at this point. It still requires some tweaking once in Builder, but it saves time getting it there. The real star is the AI code editor which saves massive amounts of times and works shockingly well!\n\n* * *\n\n[Stephanie Kwon](https://www.figma.com/@stephaniekwon)@stephaniekwon · 11 months ago\n\nlove the AI import from figma! it's not perfect yet but a big step forward. What I love about is that I can import and at least learn how to make an asset rather than leaving this all through trial and error. This has saved me a lot of time and decreased my workload when it comes to building new assets!\n\n* * *\n\n[Jesse](https://www.figma.com/@jesse75)@jesse75 · 1 year ago\n\ndidn't work for me in Chrome unfortunately.. just hangs with blank screen.\n\n* * *\n\n[patrick oleary](https://www.figma.com/@patrickoleary3)@patrickoleary3 · 1 year ago\n\nTotally new to this, combining it with other tools to get some good landing pages. It works, but not the easiest to navigate and with one page it started prompting me to upgrade my account. Which I get, but I spent a couple of minutes trying to figure out how do I export the code and images, and not just a codepen. So provide a cleaner intuitive way to get things out and more than happy to sign up.\n\n* * *\n\n[John](https://www.figma.com/@e4f75cae_be1d_4)@e4f75cae\\_be1d\\_4 · 1 year ago\n\ncode didn't work well, gonna use Subframe instead\n\n* * *\n\n[Alexandr Lisovsky](https://www.figma.com/@alexandrlisovsk)@alexandrlisovsk · 1 year ago\n\nplugin exports without pictures and frames are poorly assembled (\\><)\n\n* * *\n\n[abdel Akroh](https://www.figma.com/@abdelakroh)@abdelakroh · 1 year ago\n\nGood to know and really fast\n\n* * *\n\n**This is a Figma Community plugin.** Community is a space for Figma users to share things they create.
