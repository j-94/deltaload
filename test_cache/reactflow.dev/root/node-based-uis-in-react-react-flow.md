# Node-Based UIs in React - React Flow


Highly customizable React library for workflow builders, no-code apps, image processing, visualizers, and more


## Content

Wire Your Ideas with React Flow
-------------------------------

A customizable React component for building node-based editors and interactive diagrams
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

React Flow is a MIT-licensed open source library. You can help us to ensure the further development and maintenance by subscribing to React Flow Pro.

[React Flow Pro](https://reactflow.dev/pro)

Getting Started with React Flow

Make sure you’ve installed npm, pnpm or yarn. Then you can install React Flow via:

npm install @xyflow/react

[See full Quickstart guide](https://reactflow.dev/learn)

Ready out-of-the-box
--------------------

The things you need are already there: dragging nodes, zooming, panning, selecting multiple nodes, and adding/removing elements are all built-in.

Powered by us.  
Designed by you.
---------------------------------

React Flow nodes are simply React components, ready for your interactive elements. We play nice with Tailwind and plain old CSS.

All the right plugins
---------------------

Make more advanced apps with the Background, Minimap, Controls, Panel, NodeToolbar, and NodeResizer components.

Project Showcase

Used by thousands of people
---------------------------

From solo open-source developers, to companies like Stripe and Typeform. We’ve seen the library used for data processing tools, chatbot builders, machine learning, musical synthezisers, and more.
