Textured 3D London and High Detail City Models[3D London](https://accucities.com/author/admin/ "Posts by 3D London")2022-02-27T09:31:51+00:00

Textured City Models & Level 4 Context Models
---------------------------------------------

#### High Visual fidelity & Easy to work with

AccuCities textured 3D Model of London has been created by wrapping our large and detailed Level 3 city model in editable textures from the latest 2020 high-resolution oblique imagery. The 3D model covers 60 km sq and can be purchased from as little as 500 x 500 meters tile.

Level 4 models are based on our Level 3 High Detail 3D Models and upgraded using a combination of custom high-res photographs and terrestrial photogrammetry. All features are 3D Modelled, separated, materials are associated with geometry and where needed, the 3D models are textured. 3D Models, elevations and features are accurate to 15 cm in all axis. Terrain can also be upgraded and street furniture can be added.

#### Production Renders & Animations

AccuCities [Textured 3D Model of London](https://www.accucities.com/textured-3d-model-of-london-2021/) has been created by projecting high-res oblique imagery onto a High Detail Level 3 city model. All textures are editable on individual terrain layers and buildings. Available for £1,000+VAT for a 500 x 500 meters tile. Use our [Quoting Tool](https://quote.accucities.com/) to order.

Textured 3D Model of London Features
------------------------------------

#### Accurate, Upgradeable & Easy to Use

The textured 3D Model of London dataset was created by wrapping our large and detailed Level 3 city model in [editable textures](https://www.accucities.com/re-texturing-focus-buildings-in-3d-london/) from the latest 2020 high-resolution oblique imagery. The 3D model covers 60 km sq and can be purchased from as little as 500 x 500 meters tile.

Users can turn textures on/off for individual terrain layers, remove a building without creating a hole in the model, upgrade any of the geometry or textures and even manipulate any of the trees in the trees layer individually.

### Your site in a high visual fidelity city context

#### Simulate Views, Daylight & Sunlight and more

Save time & money by reducing the need for a crane or aerial photographs! Insert your designs directly into the accurate city environment. Use Future Skyline to simulate change over time.

### Made for Makers & Creatives

#### Update, Upgrade & Manipulate with ease

Texturing city models using aerial oblique imagery makes the process affordable but the model suffers from shadowing, especially in urban canyons. Users can upgrade their hero buildings / walkable areas / sites in few hours using image editing software.

Read [Re-texturing focus buildings in 3D London](https://www.accucities.com/re-texturing-focus-buildings-in-3d-london/) for a step-by-step guide.

### Custom Level 4 Models

#### Fully 3D modelled architectural and outdoor details

All features on Level 4 models are 3D modelled, separated, materials are associated with geometry and where needed, the 3D models are textured. 3D Models, elevations and features are accurate to 15 cm in all axis.

![Image 70: Level 3 to Level 4 3D Model Upgrade](https://www.accucities.com/wp-content/uploads/AccuCities_L3_L4_3D_Model.gif)

### **Upgrades based on Level 3 Models**

Level 3 buildings are accurate to 15cm in all axis. Using aerial stereo photogrammetry, all roofs features and structures are precisely manually captured with correct shapes and slopes. Level 4 models are captured on top of Level 3 3D Models using terrestrial photographs and manually textured.

![Image 71](https://www.accucities.com/wp-content/uploads/Level-4-AccuCities-Geometry.jpg)

### **Clean & Light Geometry**

All main facade & architectural features are 3D modelled and structured in a way that allows for different materials to be separated. Although more labour-intensive, this workflow results in significantly lighter and more usable 3D models than other techniques.

![Image 72](https://www.accucities.com/wp-content/uploads/Level-4-AccuCities-Photorealistic-Textures.jpg)

### **Photo-Realistic Textures**

For ultimate realism, Level 4 Models can be textured with photo realistic textures. Because 3D models are made from hi-res terrestrial photographs with UV mapping in mind, resulting 3D models have uniform and quality photo-realistic textures. Textured Level 4 models can be used in many 3D modelling packages or in a game engine.

![Image 73](https://www.accucities.com/wp-content/uploads/3Dformats.jpg)

### **Variety of File formats**

Level 3 3D models are delivered in AutoCad Solid DWG, SketchUp SKP and Filmbox FBX formats for easy editing that suits most workflows. The 3D Model is easy to import into Revit, 3D Studio Max, Maya or Cinema 4D.

**Level 4 3D Models of London Landmarks**
-----------------------------------------

3D Models of the most prominent London buildings are continuously upgraded to Level 4.

Level 4 models are based on our Level 3 High Detail 3D Model of London and upgraded using a combination of custom high-res photographs and terrestrial photogrammetry. All features are 3D Modelled, separated, materials are associated with geometry and where needed, the 3D models are textured. 3D Models, elevations and features are accurate to 15 cm in all axis.
