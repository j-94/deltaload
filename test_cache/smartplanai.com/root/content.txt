Generate architectural testfits for entire buildings at almost no cost

A building subscription is the cost of one testfit from an architect

Show tenants how they fit in a space in real-time, versus calling an architect and waiting 1-2 weeks

Include as part of your pitch for new buildings, as a powerful marketing differentiator and cost/time saver for landlords

Enhance tour engagement by demonstrating live how a tenant can see themselves in the space, then share a link or print multiple test-fit variations post-tourâ€”all without needing an architect

Market each space uniquely to any tenant, save up to 10x on architectural test-fit fees, and outcompete those still using conventional approaches
