# Superinterface


Build AI experiences in your product


## Content

Build interactive AI UI for your product
----------------------------------------

Add in-app AI UI to your product - with **interactive components**, **API function calling** and **voice chats**, running **any AI model**, **open-sourced**.

Powered by AI Assistants API providers big and small

Assistants you already know, extended
-------------------------------------

Add battle-hardened AI interfaces like chat with action/function calling and interactive messages to your app fast.

Voice chats and more
--------------------

Use any modality you want, from voice to text, and even custom UIs.

Activate function calls
-----------------------

Empower your assistant to perform actions and retrieve data just like your GPTs. Simply instruct your Domain GPT to take action.

Set up in seconds
-----------------

Superinterface plugs right into your technology stack. Instantly activate an AI assistant on your website with a script tag, React components or get a dedicated webpage.

Webpage benefits
----------------

No setup, instant integration

Free custom subdomain at **name.superinterface.app**

Build with production-grade tools you already use
-------------------------------------------------

Superinterface is built and can be extended with most popular tools and libraries. There is no lock-in, since you’re just using a layer above your existing stack. It just extends the ideas already set by an existing community and ecosystem.

No middleman fees for AI usage
------------------------------

Bring your own API keys from AI providers like OpenAI, Groq, Mistral and pay **directly** to them.

Tailor your chat’s look
-----------------------

Customize themes and components to match your brand perfectly.

File search, vector stores and knowledge base
---------------------------------------------

Assistants can search through files you or your users upload, access vector stores, and knowledge bases.

It’s open-source
