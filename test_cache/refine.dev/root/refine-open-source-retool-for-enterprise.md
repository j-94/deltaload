Build React-based internal tools, admin panels, dashboards & B2B apps with unmatched flexibility.

The sweet spot between low-code and full-code.
----------------------------------------------

Drag-and-drop tools shine initially but collapse under the weight of complexity. Refine offers comparable speed at the start and infinite scaling in the long run.

### Business applications not only share fundamental UI elements, but also the underlying logic.

Stop writing repetitive code for CRUD, security and state management. Let Refine automatically transform your UI elements to enterprise-grade:

Start faster, maintain easier, manage complexity.
