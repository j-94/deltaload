Devin has sparked a trend in developing Agents, but many people still question, “There is still a large amount of manual intervention in the chat process in the video” and “The things made are too simple”. They believe it is far from actually replacing programmers and is still in the experimental stage, not applicable to real industrial production.

If you harbor such doubts, I am delighted to introduce Babel — a company that specializes in cultivating software development Agent Teams. **Babel is already using Babel Agent for engineering software development, such as testing the usability of Claude 3, writing backend management systems, and integrating with the Stripe payment system, etc.**

The Babel Agent, currently in its testing phase, has demonstrated the tremendous potential of Agents to truly replace humans in software production.

Babel’s CEO, Hailong Zhang, wakes up at 5 a.m. for a business trip and hands over the task description to Babel Agent. By the time his plane lands, the task is completed without any intervention from him. You can sleep soundly, and receive a finished product that is already running when you get off the plane.

What can Babel Agent do
-----------------------

Autonomous Task Decomposition
-----------------------------

Babel Agent can design and decompose tasks autonomously based on your requirement documents, and execute them one by one.

Autonomous Coding, Compilation, and Debugging
---------------------------------------------

In the task of writing individual functions, Babel Agent not only writes code autonomously, but also compiles it autonomously, then debugs autonomously based on the issues feedback from the compilation, just like the work process of a human programmer.

Autonomous Research on Independent Problems
-------------------------------------------

When tasked with integrating the newly released Claude 3, which is not within the inherent knowledge of the large model, Babel Agent autonomously searches for the SDK, finds the documentation, writes code, and then tests and verifies it. Finally, it delivers a tested and usable Claude 3 integration module to you.

Autonomous Testing
------------------

When necessary, Babel Agent will write automated test code, execute tests, and self-correct issues.

Seeking Human Assistance
------------------------

Of course, when encountering unclear requirements or when necessary information is not provided, Babel Agent will seek human assistance. Also, it will do the same if it can’t complete a task after trying different ways.

Iterative Development
---------------------

Babel Agent supports iterative changes to requirements and autonomous corrections of online issues — yes, it’s as intelligent as your development team.

AI Replece Human?
-----------------

Babel Agent is not omnipotent. For instance, Babel Agent does not support iteration on legacy systems, but can only interact with old systems via APIs. Currently, it only supports backend development.

But overall, jobs that previously required hiring two junior developers may indeed no longer necessary. Babel Agent can take a substantial portion of the work typically handled by junior programmers. Humans will take on the responsibility of defining requirements, whereas high-level programmers will be entrusted with resolving more challenging issues.

Babel is currently still in the testing phase. We are building advanced abilities for Babel Agents such as visual web browsing, runtime tracing, shell commands…to enable the agents tackle more complex scenarios. We are looking for real life projects for our agents to build. If you have serious project that can be outsourced to build, you are welcomed to contact us contact@babel.cloud.
