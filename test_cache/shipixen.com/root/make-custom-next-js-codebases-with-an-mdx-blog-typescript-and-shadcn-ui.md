Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Looking to learn more about Shipixen? Here are some of the most common questions we get asked.  
If you have additional questions, please feel free to [contact us](mailto:support@shipixen.com)!

*   ### What is Shipixen exactly?
    
    Shipixen is an app that generates boilerplate code with your branding, pages and much more.  
    You get a git repository and/or a zip file with the code. You can then modify the code as you want and deploy it to any host that supports Next.js.
    
*   ### How does the license work?
    
    If you have a license, you can generate as many websites as you want.  
    You then own the code, the license only applies to the app.  
    You can use the generated code for commercial purposes.
    
*   ### How many websites can I generate?
    
    With a valid license, you can generate as many websites as you want.  
    Any website you generate is yours to keep forever (you get a zip & git repository).
    
*   ### Where can I deploy the generated code?
    
    We make a deployment to Vercel for you as part of the generation process. However, since you own the code, so you can deploy it on any host that supports Next.js. If you have a license, you can generate as many websites as you want.
    
*   ### How does the blog work?
    
    The blog is built with Next.js & MDX. You can write your posts in Markdown & they will be rendered as HTML. It's SEO-optimized & supports search, tags, code blocks, multiple authors, multiple layouts and much more.  
    Read more about it [in the docs](https://shipixen.com/boilerplate-documentation/using-the-shipixen-blog#main).
    
*   ### Who can use Shipixen? Is it no-code?
    
    While you don't need any prior knowledge to generate & deploy a site, you'll need to be comfortable making code changes to e.g. write blog posts. Further changes would require beginner experience with web development & React. Shipixen only helps with the initial code generation, but you'll have to change the code afterwards.
    
*   ### Can I get a refund?
    
    If you haven't used your license, you can get a refund within 7 days of purchase. However, after you've used your license you will also have access to the generated code, so we can't offer a refund.  
    We're confident you'll love Shipixen, most people deploy in minutes and are able to ship & grow their product faster than ever before.
    
*   ### Can I use Shipixen for payments, Stripe etc.
    
    The generated output doesn't currently include any payment integration; it'll only create a landing page, blog, pricing page & other pages you have selected. You'll have to add the integration yourself. We're always improving Shipixen, so that might change in the future. In the meantime, you might want to check out [ShipFast](https://shipfa.st/).
    
*   ### Can I use Shipixen to learn web development?
    
    Yes, if you have some prior web development/front-end experience, Shipixen could be a great way to level up your skills. You can use the generated code as a starting point and modify it as you want.
    
*   ### Will the generated code be human readable
    
    Yes, although some of the generation is done with AI, the code is perfectly readable and uses components that are easy to understand. Check out the [component documentation](https://shipixen.com/boilerplate-documentation/landing-page-components#main) to see examples.
    
*   ### What's the tech stack in the boilerplate
    
    The boilerplate is built with React, Next.js 14 with App Router, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript & MDX powered by Contentlayer. The UI library is made with Shadcn UI and icons are from Lucide.
    
*   ### What platforms will Shipixen work in?
    
    The Shipixen app currently works on [macOS](https://shipixen.com/download/macos) and [Windows](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/shipixen/9P39S3JNLJ8H) only.
    
*   ### Is Shipixen using TypeScript?

Here are some of the most common questions we get asked.  \nIf you have additional questions, please feel free to [contact us](mailto:support@shipixen.com)!\n\n*   ### What is Shipixen exactly?\n    \n    Shipixen is an app that generates boilerplate code with your branding, pages and much more.  \n    You get a git repository and/or a zip file with the code. You can then modify the code as you want and deploy it to any host that supports Next.js.\n    \n*   ### How does the license work?\n    \n    If you have a license, you can generate as many websites as you want.  \n    You then own the code, the license only applies to the app.  \n    You can use the generated code for commercial purposes.\n    \n*   ### How many websites can I generate?\n    \n    With a valid license, you can generate as many websites as you want.  \n    Any website you generate is yours to keep forever (you get a zip & git repository).\n    \n*   ### Where can I deploy the generated code?\n    \n    We make a deployment to Vercel for you as part of the generation process. However, since you own the code, so you can deploy it on any host that supports Next.js. If you have a license, you can generate as many websites as you want.\n    \n*   ### How does the blog work?\n    \n    The blog is built with Next.js & MDX. You can write your posts in Markdown & they will be rendered as HTML. It's SEO-optimized & supports search, tags, code blocks, multiple authors, multiple layouts and much more.  \n    Read more about it [in the docs](https://shipixen.com/boilerplate-documentation/using-the-shipixen-blog#main).\n    \n*   ### Who can use Shipixen? Is it no-code?\n    \n    While you don't need any prior knowledge to generate & deploy a site, you'll need to be comfortable making code changes to e.g. write blog posts. Further changes would require beginner experience with web development & React. Shipixen only helps with the initial code generation, but you'll have to change the code afterwards.\n    \n*   ### Can I get a refund?\n    \n    If you haven't used your license, you can get a refund within 7 days of purchase. However, after you've used your license you will also have access to the generated code, so we can't offer a refund.  \n    We're confident you'll love Shipixen, most people deploy in minutes and are able to ship & grow their product faster than ever before.\n    \n*   ### Can I use Shipixen for payments, Stripe etc.\n    \n    The generated output doesn't currently include any payment integration; it'll only create a landing page, blog, pricing page & other pages you have selected. You'll have to add the integration yourself. We're always improving Shipixen, so that might change in the future. In the meantime, you might want to check out [ShipFast](https://shipfa.st/).\n    \n*   ### Can I use Shipixen to learn web development?\n    \n    Yes, if you have some prior web development/front-end experience, Shipixen could be a great way to level up your skills. You can use the generated code as a starting point and modify it as you want.\n    \n*   ### Will the generated code be human readable\n    \n    Yes, although some of the generation is done with AI, the code is perfectly readable and uses components that are easy to understand. Check out the [component documentation](https://shipixen.com/boilerplate-documentation/landing-page-components#main) to see examples.\n    \n*   ### What's the tech stack in the boilerplate\n    \n    The boilerplate is built with React, Next.js 14 with App Router, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript & MDX powered by Contentlayer. The UI library is made with Shadcn UI and icons are from Lucide.\n    \n*   ### What platforms will Shipixen work in?\n    \n    The Shipixen app currently works on [macOS](https://shipixen.com/download/macos) and [Windows](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/shipixen/9P39S3JNLJ8H) only.\n    \n*   ### Is Shipixen using TypeScript?\n    \n    Yes, Shipixen is built with TypeScript.",
