##### What is a Due Diligence report?

[Click here](https://www.archistar.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Archistar-Sample-Report.pdf) for a sample Archistar Development Due Diligence report.

The Development Due Diligence (or DDD) is commonly used as a 'highest and best use' report, answering the question, "How can I best use this piece of land?".

The report consolidates and presents almost everything that the Archistar platform has to offer. This includes planning details, applicable layers, market details, suburb insights, nearby developments, generated designs, analysis on designs and feasibility on designs. This report is customisable and white-labelled, meaning you can insert your name and brand to download and present to clients and/or stakeholders.

##### What documents can I purchase and how much are they?

Title Search documents and Contamination Reports are currently available for purchase on a site-by-site basis. Simply select a site to view the document prices.

It depends! Please submit a [demo request](https://www.archistar.ai/demo) and our friendly team will be in contact to discuss a custom package that suits your needs.

##### Can I get a plan that is shorter than 12 months?

Please [book a demo](https://www.archistar.ai/demo) with our team and we can work together to discover if your circumstances require a custom package.

##### Can I request for new data to be added?

Yes, we actively encourage this! Our platform has been built off of industry feedback, much of what you see today is due to direct requests from property professionals who are tired of the traditional method of research and assessment.

Customers on the highest tier package receive a direct line to the product team for prioiritised feature requests.
