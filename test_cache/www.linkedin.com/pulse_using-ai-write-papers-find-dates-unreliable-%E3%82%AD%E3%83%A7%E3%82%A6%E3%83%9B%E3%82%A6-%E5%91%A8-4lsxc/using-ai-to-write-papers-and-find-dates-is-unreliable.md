Using AI to Write Papers and Find Dates Is Unreliable

Recently, the AI community has been buzzing with news about a 23-year-old Russian guy, Aleksandr Zhadan, who reportedly used GPT to chat with 5,239 girls on a dating app, eventually getting engaged to one of them.

Many reports hail this event as a sign of the AI era, impacting our ways of living. However, highlighting only the sensational parts doesn't accurately represent the situation. A computer scientist on X (Twitter), Ate-a-Pi, meticulously examined the Russian guy's tweets and community-shared content, outlining how he found a girlfriend. Let's take a closer look.

First, he found girls to chat with; then, he chatted with them.

How did he find them? Through the dating app Tinder, using web crawler-like tools to fetch users' photos and basic information such as age and zodiac signs, only if they matched his criteria. The standard for photos was to have more than two, and they had to be of types Aleksandr liked. This preference was determined through training with neural network algorithms on the photos he favored, then scraping through users based on this standard.

Once a match was found, the bot would initiate a greeting. The aim of the chat was not aimless but to quickly facilitate a meeting. This project began in March 2022, before ChatGPT's release, using only GPT-3's API. He instructed GPT-3: You're a boy talking to a girl for the first time, with the task of inviting her on a date.

Initially, GPT-3 performed poorly, often forgetting what it had just said, making the girls think something was off. Even when some girls agreed and shared their Telegram (similar to WeChat) hoping to continue chatting there, Aleksandr's software couldn't access Telegram, missing many follow-ups.

Some dates were arranged on Tinder, and Aleksandr met them offline, but the outcomes were disappointing. Because GPT-3 had promised flowers and chocolates during chats, which Aleksandr was unaware of due to not reviewing the chat logs, meeting without these promised gifts led to disappointment.

This was the first version of the dating robot, matching 353 girls on Tinder, chatting with 160, and dating 12 offline, about 7.5% of the chats. The first version was also the longest developed and used.

The second version, upgraded to GPT-4, introduced:

1\. Individual memory for each girl chatted with;

2\. Message synchronization between Telegram and Tinder;

3\. Integration with Google Calendar;

4\. Manual verification for critical questions, avoiding direct replies.

This version matched with 4,886 girls on Tinder, resulting in countless dates. For example, in April 2023, Aleksandr had 96 dates, averaging three a day. With some, he went on multiple dates. He claimed to have maintained dating relationships with up to four girls at a time. Mostly, GPT-4 chatted with these girls, keeping the connection warm. Important chat content automatically alerted Aleksandr.

After extensive chatting and dating, a girl named Karina emerged as the ideal choice, leading to the deactivation of all other chat bots except the one for Karina. To ensure success, the bot was programmed to maintain a good relationship with Karina, alerting Aleksandr to any negative issues or questions needing answers.

Now focused on just one person, what was Aleksandr doing during this time?

He believed that after chatting with over 5,200 people via the first and second versions of the robot, he had gathered significant information, especially those insights not available on resumes, such as genuine personal thoughts. He used a Russian employment website to match these insights with job listings, recommending jobs for them. Eventually, eight people were hired through this matching system. He even planned to sell the contact information formed from the previous dating robots.

Later, the third version of the robot exclusively chatted with Karina, leading to discussions about marriage and designing a honeymoon trip. They actually traveled to Macau and Hong Kong based on GPT's suggestions, followed by a proposal and marriage registration. According to Aleksandr, they plan to have a more formal and grand wedding in August 2024. It was only on the day of the marriage registration that Karina learned many of their conversations had been assisted by GPT, but she reacted calmly.

This story outlines the use of AI in finding a spouse. Many are amazed by the rapid progress of technology, while others criticize Aleksandr's method of mass-processing emotions and selling personal information. However, I believe such reactions are unnecessary. This story is likely his personal publicity stunt, with no such dramatic girlfriend existing.

Firstly, despite his fascinating achievements and compelling stories, he is not a developer on Github, contributing no code. So, why didn't he share this amazing story since its inception in March 2022?

Additionally, this isn't his first brush with fame. Known for self-promotion since university, he

previously gained attention around February 2023 for writing his thesis with ChatGPT, with his school even allowing him to graduate under these circumstances. This story attracted much media attention.

He graduated from the Russian State University for the Humanities with a degree in Modern Organization Management. Currently, he works as a product manager at TenChat, a social platform with recruitment features, similar to LinkedIn. His sharing of this story on X was purely for publicity, the specifics of which are yet to be fully uncovered. The dating, engagement, and registration might all be fabricated.

Recall he stopped chatting with others after focusing on Karina. Initially, using GPT for mass chatting, although unethical, had the excuse of efficiency due to the potential high number of matches. This excuse might be deemed acceptable.

But after focusing on Karina, was there still a need to replace himself with ChatGPT in communications? How tiresome must his girlfriend's chatting be to necessitate a chat robot for coping? His explanation involves using the second version robot to match chat content with job listings on TenChat, his employer's platform.

Isn't this too coincidental? Was he looking for a girlfriend or testing a product? Or did he concoct a story for platform advertising in collusion with his company?

It might be a mix of these. Most likely, it's his personal endeavor. His company might be developing similar products, but not through scraping dating app information for recruitment platforms. Instead, they're likely gathering information in less controversial areas, like using their website's job applications and resumes to design a chat robot for preliminary automated conversations with job seekers, then matching them with employers' needs.

He found this function interesting and added features for scraping content from other software, actually engaging in some conversations with those users. The quality of these conversations, at least good enough for promotional screenshots, was sufficient.

He might indeed have a girlfriend named Karina, possibly even married, but not through the method described in the story. Their meeting was likely through normal means, like friend introductions or previous school or work connections. Karina might be willing to support his story for the sake of boosting Aleksandr's industry profile, given his name is now known even thousands of miles away.

It's hard to understand her calm reaction upon learning about GPT's involvement in their chats only at the marriage registration.

Another dubious point is his expenditure. He claimed the GPT API cost $1,432, reasonable if spread over two years of daily chatting. Restaurant date expenses amounted to 200,000 rubles, about 15,000 yuan, which seems low. Considering the screenshots from April 2023, with 96 dates in one month, even if such dating lasted only three months, and assuming expenses were split, each date's cost seems minimal.

The side business of job matching, supposedly earning him 526,000 rubles (about 40,000 yuan), implies a significant commission per successful job placement, tempting even for non-programmers.

All these are guesses based on his tweets. The truth is known only to him and those close to him. From my experience with GPT-4, its capabilities before their engagement were not strong enough to maintain a long-term dating relationship with a woman while simultaneously engaging with multiple others, without her noticing something amiss.

Even today, GPT cannot maintain both online and offline romantic relationships through text alone. It can organize routine, redundant, formatted platitudes and provide specific minor tips, but not sustain a love relationship solely through text.

Before clarifying these issues, there's no need for further speculation on technological advancements or devising supposed new profit models and product ideas.

That's all for today. See you tomorrow.

However, highlighting only the sensational parts doesn't accurately represent the situation. A computer scientist on X (Twitter), Ate-a-Pi, meticulously examined the Russian guy's tweets and community-shared content, outlining how he found a girlfriend. Let's take a closer look.\n\nFirst, he found girls to chat with; then, he chatted with them.\n\nHow did he find them? Through the dating app Tinder, using web crawler-like tools to fetch users' photos and basic information such as age and zodiac signs, only if they matched his criteria. The standard for photos was to have more than two, and they had to be of types Aleksandr liked. This preference was determined through training with neural network algorithms on the photos he favored, then scraping through users based on this standard.\n\nOnce a match was found, the bot would initiate a greeting. The aim of the chat was not aimless but to quickly facilitate a meeting. This project began in March 2022, before ChatGPT's release, using only GPT-3's API. He instructed GPT-3: You're a boy talking to a girl for the first time, with the task of inviting her on a date.\n\nInitially, GPT-3 performed poorly, often forgetting what it had just said, making the girls think something was off. Even when some girls agreed and shared their Telegram (similar to WeChat) hoping to continue chatting there, Aleksandr's software couldn't access Telegram, missing many follow-ups.\n\nSome dates were arranged on Tinder, and Aleksandr met them offline, but the outcomes were disappointing. Because GPT-3 had promised flowers and chocolates during chats, which Aleksandr was unaware of due to not reviewing the chat logs, meeting without these promised gifts led to disappointment.\n\nThis was the first version of the dating robot, matching 353 girls on Tinder, chatting with 160, and dating 12 offline, about 7.5% of the chats. The first version was also the longest developed and used.\n\nThe second version, upgraded to GPT-4, introduced:\n\n1\\. Individual memory for each girl chatted with;\n\n2\\. Message synchronization between Telegram and Tinder;\n\n3\\. Integration with Google Calendar;\n\n4\\. Manual verification for critical questions, avoiding direct replies.\n\nThis version matched with 4,886 girls on Tinder, resulting in countless dates. For example, in April 2023, Aleksandr had 96 dates, averaging three a day. With some, he went on multiple dates. He claimed to have maintained dating relationships with up to four girls at a time. Mostly, GPT-4 chatted with these girls, keeping the connection warm. Important chat content automatically alerted Aleksandr.\n\nAfter extensive chatting and dating, a girl named Karina emerged as the ideal choice, leading to the deactivation of all other chat bots except the one for Karina. To ensure success, the bot was programmed to maintain a good relationship with Karina, alerting Aleksandr to any negative issues or questions needing answers.\n\nNow focused on just one person, what was Aleksandr doing during this time?\n\nHe believed that after chatting with over 5,200 people via the first and second versions of the robot, he had gathered significant information, especially those insights not available on resumes, such as genuine personal thoughts. He used a Russian employment website to match these insights with job listings, recommending jobs for them. Eventually, eight people were hired through this matching system. He even planned to sell the contact information formed from the previous dating robots.\n\nLater, the third version of the robot exclusively chatted with Karina, leading to discussions about marriage and designing a honeymoon trip. They actually traveled to Macau and Hong Kong based on GPT's suggestions, followed by a proposal and marriage registration. According to Aleksandr, they plan to have a more formal and grand wedding in August 2024. It was only on the day of the marriage registration that Karina learned many of their conversations had been assisted by GPT, but she reacted calmly.\n\nThis story outlines the use of AI in finding a spouse. Many are amazed by the rapid progress of technology, while others criticize Aleksandr's method of mass-processing emotions and selling personal information. However, I believe such reactions are unnecessary. This story is likely his personal publicity stunt, with no such dramatic girlfriend existing.\n\nFirstly, despite his fascinating achievements and compelling stories, he is not a developer on Github, contributing no code. So, why didn't he share this amazing story since its inception in March 2022?\n\nAdditionally, this isn't his first brush with fame. Known for self-promotion since university, he\n\npreviously gained attention around February 2023 for writing his thesis with ChatGPT, with his school even allowing him to graduate under these circumstances. This story attracted much media attention.\n\nHe graduated from the Russian State University for the Humanities with a degree in Modern Organization Management. Currently, he works as a product manager at TenChat, a social platform with recruitment features, similar to LinkedIn. His sharing of this story on X was purely for publicity, the specifics of which are yet to be fully uncovered. The dating, engagement, and registration might all be fabricated.\n\nRecall he stopped chatting with others after focusing on Karina. Initially, using GPT for mass chatting, although unethical, had the excuse of efficiency due to the potential high number of matches. This excuse might be deemed acceptable.\n\nBut after focusing on Karina, was there still a need to replace himself with ChatGPT in communications? How tiresome must his girlfriend's chatting be to necessitate a chat robot for coping? His explanation involves using the second version robot to match chat content with job listings on TenChat, his employer's platform.\n\nIsn't this too coincidental? Was he looking for a girlfriend or testing a product? Or did he concoct a story for platform advertising in collusion with his company?\n\nIt might be a mix of these. Most likely, it's his personal endeavor. His company might be developing similar products, but not through scraping dating app information for recruitment platforms. Instead, they're likely gathering information in less controversial areas, like using their website's job applications and resumes to design a chat robot for preliminary automated conversations with job seekers, then matching them with employers' needs.\n\nHe found this function interesting and added features for scraping content from other software, actually engaging in some conversations with those users. The quality of these conversations, at least good enough for promotional screenshots, was sufficient.\n\nHe might indeed have a girlfriend named Karina, possibly even married, but not through the method described in the story. Their meeting was likely through normal means, like friend introductions or previous school or work connections. Karina might be willing to support his story for the sake of boosting Aleksandr's industry profile, given his name is now known even thousands of miles away.\n\nIt's hard to understand her calm reaction upon learning about GPT's involvement in their chats only at the marriage registration.\n\nAnother dubious point is his expenditure. He claimed the GPT API cost $1,432, reasonable if spread over two years of daily chatting. Restaurant date expenses amounted to 200,000 rubles, about 15,000 yuan, which seems low. Considering the screenshots from April 2023, with 96 dates in one month, even if such dating lasted only three months, and assuming expenses were split, each date's cost seems minimal.\n\nThe side business of job matching, supposedly earning him 526,000 rubles (about 40,000 yuan), implies a significant commission per successful job placement, tempting even for non-programmers.\n\nAll these are guesses based on his tweets. The truth is known only to him and those close to him. From my experience with GPT-4, its capabilities before their engagement were not strong enough to maintain a long-term dating relationship with a woman while simultaneously engaging with multiple others, without her noticing something amiss.\n\nEven today, GPT cannot maintain both online and offline romantic relationships through text alone. It can organize routine, redundant, formatted platitudes and provide specific minor tips, but not sustain a love relationship solely through text.\n\nBefore clarifying these issues, there's no need for further speculation on technological advancements or devising supposed new profit models and product ideas.\n\nThat's all for today. See you tomorrow.\n\n    \n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=%2Fpulse%2Fusing-ai-write-papers-find-dates-unreliable-%25E3%2582%25AD%25E3%2583%25A7%25E3%2582%25A6%25E3%2583%259B%25E3%2582%25A6-%25E5%2591%25A8-4lsxc&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_x-social-details_like-toggle_like-cta)\n\n ![Image 36: Like](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-ai-write-papers-find-dates-unreliable-%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9B%E3%82%A6-%E5%91%A8-4lsxc) Like\n\n![Image 37: Celebrate](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-ai-write-papers-find-dates-unreliable-%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9B%E3%82%A6-%E5%91%A8-4lsxc) Celebrate\n\n![Image 38: Support](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-ai-write-papers-find-dates-unreliable-%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9B%E3%82%A6-%E5%91%A8-4lsxc) Support\n\n![Image 39: Love](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-ai-write-papers-find-dates-unreliable-%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9B%E3%82%A6-%E5%91%A8-4lsxc) Love\n\n![Image 40: Insightful](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-ai-write-papers-find-dates-unreliable-%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9B%E3%82%A6-%E5%91%A8-4lsxc) Insightful\n\n![Image 41: Funny](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-ai-write-papers-find-dates-unreliable-%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9B%E3%82%A6-%E5%91%A8-4lsxc) Funny\n\n[Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=%2Fpulse%2Fusing-ai-write-papers-find-dates-unreliable-%25E3%2582%25AD%25E3%2583%25A7%25E3%2582%25A6%25E3%2583%259B%25E3%2582%25A6-%25E5%2591%25A8-4lsxc&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_comment-cta)\n\n \n\n*   Copy\n*   LinkedIn\n*   Facebook\n*   Twitter\n\nShare\n\n \n\n [![Image 42](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-ai-write-papers-find-dates-unreliable-%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9B%E3%82%A6-%E5%91%A8-4lsxc) 2](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=%2Fpulse%2Fusing-ai-write-papers-find-dates-unreliable-%25E3%2582%25AD%25E3%2583%25A7%25E3%2582%25A6%25E3%2583%259B%25E3%2582%25A6-%25E5%2591%25A8-4lsxc&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_x-social-details_likes-count_social-actions-reactions)         \n\nTo view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=%2Fpulse%2Fusing-ai-write-papers-find-dates-unreliable-%25E3%2582%25AD%25E3%2583%25A7%25E3%2582%25A6%25E3%2583%259B%25E3%2582%25A6-%25E5%2591%25A8-4lsxc&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_x-social-details_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n\nMore articles by QIAOFENG ZHOU\n------------------------------\n\n*   [次世代ハイエンドプロセッサの分析](https://jp.linkedin.com/pulse/%E6%AC%A1%E4%B8%96%E4%BB%A3%E3%83%8F%E3%82%A4%E3%82%A8%E3%83%B3%E3%83%89%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%BB%E3%83%83%E3%82%B5%E3%81%AE%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90-%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9B%E3%82%A6-%E5%91%A8-8eslc)\n    \n    ![Image 43](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-ai-write-papers-find-dates-unreliable-%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9B%E3%82%A6-%E5%91%A8-4lsxc)\n    \n    Jun 12, 2024\n    \n    ### 次世代ハイエンドプロセッサの分析\n    \n    年に一度の台北コンピュータエキスポが再び幕を閉じました！今回のタイミングにより、各大チップメーカーは大きな動きを見せました。 これから発売予定のハイエンドプロセッサについて話しましょう。 1.AMDについて まずはAMDからです。…\n    \n     \n    \n    ![Image 44](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-ai-write-papers-find-dates-unreliable-%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9B%E3%82%A6-%E5%91%A8-4lsxc) 3\n    \n            \n    \n*   [2024年下半期のAI技術に対する私の予測](https://jp.linkedin.com/pulse/2024%E5%B9%B4%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%8A%E6%9C%9F%E3%81%AEai%E6%8A%80%E8%A1%93%E3%81%AB%E5%AF%BE%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E7%A7%81%E3%81%AE%E4%BA%88%E6%B8%AC-%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9B%E3%82%A6-%E5%91%A8-ei7cc)\n    \n    ![Image 45](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-ai-write-papers-find-dates-unreliable-%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9B%E3%82%A6-%E5%91%A8-4lsxc)\n    \n    Jun 11, 2024\n    \n    ### 2024年下半期のAI技術に対する私の予測\n    \n    １．AIが世界に与える影響はさらに強まる…\n    \n     \n    \n    ![Image 46](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-ai-write-papers-find-dates-unreliable-%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9B%E3%82%A6-%E5%91%A8-4lsxc) 7\n    \n            \n    \n*   [My Predictions for AI Technology in the Second Half of 2024](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-predictions-ai-technology-second-half-2024-%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9B%E3%82%A6-%E5%91%A8-tqijc)\n    \n    ![Image 47](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-ai-write-papers-find-dates-unreliable-%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9B%E3%82%A6-%E5%91%A8-4lsxc)\n    \n    Jun 11, 2024\n    \n    ### My Predictions for AI Technology in the Second Half of 2024\n    \n    1.The Impact of AI on the World Will Further Intensify In simple terms, AI will be used to cause significant trouble.\n    \n     \n    \n    ![Image 48](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-ai-write-papers-find-dates-unreliable-%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9B%E3%82%A6-%E5%91%A8-4lsxc) 1\n    \n            \n    \n*   [Where is Apple's AI?
