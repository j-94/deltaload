GenAI prompt & chain engineering,  
is actually config-management & orchestration in disguise
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generative AI's "Few-shot" flexibility removes model build constraints, shifting the challenge towards orchestration. Most SDKs resist this change, keeping inflexible Python classes. Edgechains presents a declarative config solution built on Google's jsonnet, shifting the paradigm to orchestration. It allows users to orchestrate and develop Generative AI applications without toxic complexity & powerful enough to model config pipelines of 100k LOC...

### Example API for edgechains  

```
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;import org.springframework.context.annotation.Primary;@Bean@Primarypublic CorsEnableOrigins corsEnableOrigins() {    CorsEnableOrigins origins = new CorsEnableOrigins();    origins.setOrigins(Collections.singletonList(        "http://localhost:4200", "http://localhost:4201", "http://localhost:4202"));    return origins;}
```

Jsonnet – A data templating language (used at Kubernetes, Tanka, Google and AllenNLP)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Born at Google

Google Google, Mountain View

* * *

The name Jsonnet is a portmanteau of JSON and sonnet, pronounced "jay sonnet". It began life early 2014 as a 20% project and was launched on Aug 6. The design is influenced by several configuration languages internal to Google, and embodies years of experience configuring some of the world's most complex IT systems. Jsonnet is now used by many companies and projects. Jsonnet is a functional lazy evaluated language that supports powerful referential concepts. Compared to Javascript, which on the other hand, is an imperative programming language. Jsonnet is going to allow you to write said DSL faster using functions and it's going to be simpler and less prone to errors.

Initially inspired by GCL (Generic/Google Config Language) - which is a language that uses dynamic scope. GCL codebase at Google is about 180 Million lines of code.

Tools like Zapier, Customer.io's webhooks, etc. allow integration with arbitrary APIs and have become a standard part of many marketing/sales stacks. These apps use things like Jinja, Mustache, or Liquid which are great for text but not JSON templates. CloudFormation built function semantics on top of JSON/YAML twice: once in the form of templates and again in the form of its intrinsic functions. A more comprehensive comparison is in the official [documentation](https://jsonnet.org/articles/comparisons.html).

is `prompt X chain X llm` not equal to `node X service X pod` ? Different pieces of config move at different velocities (e.g. Service configs move faster than node configs) - similarly, prompts move fastest, then chains and LLM configs move the slowest.

Why Jsonnet ?
-------------

Being a superset of JSON, the syntax is very similar.
