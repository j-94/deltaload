Ground screws at home

It’s important to have a stable foundation for every construction project, but digging down concrete supports is tiring, hard work. We have a better alternative – we install ground screws for your project so that you can focus on the construction itself. By using our ground screws you can quickly complete your dream project, whether it’s a wooden deck, fence, staircase, shed or playhouse for the kids. Get inspired by what others have built.

### PLAN YOUR CONSTRUCTION PROJECT – BOOK IN A GROUND SCREW INSTALLATION

[Contact us](https://stopdigging.co.uk/find-your-installer) when you start planning your construction project so that you can avoid mixing concrete blocks and heavy excavation right from the start. We’ll find the best solution and give you a cost estimate. Then you can take your measurements, add up all the materials you need and go to your building materials supplier. When you’re ready we can set a date for the ground screw installation.

### OUR GROUND SCREW INSTALLATIONS GO QUICKLY AND SMOOTHLY

When it’s time, we will come to you and install everything you need. We pre-drill the ground to the right depth depending on the ground screws to be used. This helps the ground screws to stand as straight as possible, achieving the greatest possible capacity for the ground. Any smaller rocks can be broken down. The equipment is light and portable and won’t wreck your garden.

### THE LAST GROUND SCREW IS IN PLACE – START BUILDING!

StopDigging installs your ground screw foundation quickly and the moment we have placed the last ground screw, you, or someone else, can start building. You don’t have to wait for the concrete to harden and don’t need to think about replacing the soil around the ground screws. If you’re itching to get started, just go for it!

GROUND SCREWS VS CONCRETE FOUNDATION POSTS
------------------------------------------

###### SIMPLE, QUICK AND MORE SUSTAINABLE. GROUND SCREWS WORK LIKE CONCRETE FOUNDATION POSTS, BUT BETTER.

Fast, stylish, cheap, durable, climate-friendly – just pick your benefit. The advantages of ground screws are many, but above all it’s the reduction in time and effort: You don’t have to transport and dig down heavy concrete supports, or alternatively, cast your own supports and wait until they harden. StopDigging’s ground screws shouldn’t be confused with simple earth anchors from the construction trade that you place in the ground yourself. We install the ground screws for you quickly and professionally, using our special machines. Then you have a stable foundation and can immediately start building.

WE SIMPLIFY YOUR FOUNDATION WORK
--------------------------------

###### GROUND SCREW, EARTH SCREW, SCREW ANCHOR, EARTH ANCHOR, FOUNDATION SCREW OR PIER ANCHOR – THIS SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE FOUNDATION HAS MANY NAMES.

StopDigging’s ground screw works the same way as a concrete post or pier block, whilst outperforming it across the board. With our ground screws, you can quickly and easily set out a stable foundation and begin construction immediately. Our ground screws are the best solution for supporting wooden decks, sheds, greenhouses, conservatories, carports or other structures such as flagpoles, signs or fences. StopDigging offers a range of ground screws in different models and sizes to cater to whatever building project you have in mind, and on whatever terrain. Whether the ground is soft or hard, our ground screws are fully functional when installed and there is no need to waste time waiting for wet concrete to set.
