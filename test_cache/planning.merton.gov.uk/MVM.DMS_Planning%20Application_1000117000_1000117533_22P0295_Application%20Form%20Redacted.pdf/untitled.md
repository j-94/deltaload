can be reviewed in our common projects section. If your proposals do not meet these conditions, it is advisable not to continue with this application.

Note that where the proposed extension will be joined to an existing extension, the measurement must represent the total enlargement (i.e. both the existing and proposed extensions) to the original dwellinghouse. Is the dwellinghouse to be extended within any of the following: a conservation area; an area of outstanding natural beauty; an area specified by the Secretary of State for the purposes of enhancement and protection of the natural beauty and amenity of the countryside; the Broads; a National Park; a World Heritage Site; a site of special scientific interest; Detached Other Yes No Yes No
