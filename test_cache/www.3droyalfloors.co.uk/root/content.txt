3D Royal Floors
===============

3D Royal Floors provide high quality microcement and resin solutions for your floors, walls and other surfaces to residential and commercial customers throughout London.

[ABOUT US](https://www.3droyalfloors.co.uk/about-us/)

SEAMLESS CEMENT TOPPING

MICROCEMENT
-----------

Microcement is a seamless cement topping designed to achieve in record time a polished concrete look surface finish.

A Microcement floor gives the crisp look and feel of solid concrete but with a depth of only 2.5-3 millimetres and it looks fabulous on walls too.

Micro suggests how thin this finish can be laid and Cement means that it is made on cementitious products.

TIMELESS SHADES & UNIQUE PALETTES

LUXURY RESIN FLOORS
-------------------

Resin floors create a special look with cool greys as a base or ‘home-sweet-home’ effect warm cosy colours.

Everything is possible when choosing a resin floor finish. Resin floors are very flexible. They can even be rolled just like a vinyl after it is fully cured. This allows us to install it on any substrates – wooden, cement based, existing tiles etc.

The colour shades are timeless and form a unique palette, suitable for almost any interior.

We have just had a microcement floor laid by 3D Royal Floors and the experience and results were first class.

Victor provided good advice, a good price, and worked around our schedule. And Slava and the team were professional, reliable, friendly and quick with the installation.

They will not be the cheapest, but certainly not the most expensive, and once we'd met Victor and he'd talked us through his thoughts on our project, we were only ever going to go with him.

Highly recommended.

Victor and the 3D flooring crew honestly saved my refurb. Not only were the micro cement floors they put down done expertly in exactly the time frame quoted, Victor and his team seamlessly and with utmost professionalism coordinated with third party contractors that were a pain to work with. When the third party contractors failed to complete the project, Victor went above and beyond by recommending workers who ultimately turned our construction site into a beautiful home. Literally all thanks to Victor! I absolutely plan to use 3D Floors again!

3D Royal Floors installed 250m2 of poured resin floor in our new build home.
As fussy as I am as a customer, I could not fauit their knowledge in their product, their work ethic, their attention to detail or their wish to deliver an excellent customer experience.
The floor is a complete success in our home and one of the main wow factors that everyone will comment on.
I'm happy to recommend them and their product, without reservation.

Thank you for a great product and a reliable service!
I’ve got a beautiful concrete effect resin floor  laid seamless with the microcement all over our walls. I really enjoy the new contemporary look of our home. The floor is warm and comfortable. The resin floor and microcement walls are waterproof, therefore I have them in my bathroom as well. See pictures.
I would definitely recommend 3D Royal Floors company to anyone looking for a resin or microcement.

OUTSTANDING COLOUR CHOICES

COLOUR OPTIONS
--------------

Microcement is a seamless cement topping designed to achieve in record time a polished concrete look surface finish.

A Microcement floor gives the crisp look and feel of solid concrete but with a depth of only 2.5-3 millimetres and it looks fabulous on walls too.

Micro suggests how thin this finish can be laid and Cement means that it is made on cementitious products.
