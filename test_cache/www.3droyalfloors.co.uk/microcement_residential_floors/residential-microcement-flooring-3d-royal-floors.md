substrate. It will not crack unless caused by movements in the sub floor or excess tensile forces.However, the product has a degree flexibility which makes it ideal for home flooring and walls.

#### [How do you clean a Microcement floor?](https://www.3droyalfloors.co.uk/microcement/residential/floors/#b8cd2bf69a6a5d609)

The full curing period for the micro cement is 1 month. Lightfoot traffic is allowed within 2 days, once the top coat is cured. Within the curing period no liquids are allowed on the floor. Daily maintenance is similar to other hard floors, like a wooden or vinyl floor. Use neutral soap for cleaning the microcement finish. The soap should not be left on the surface for too long. It should be removed from the surface with a clean damp cloth. It is advisable to avoid permanent flooding and prolonged contact with moisture. You must therefore avoid wet carpets and towels on the floor or e.g. flower pots that spill water. Keep the surface free of stone or sand, which can leave scratches. Excess of grid and dust will scratch the surface. A doormat is advised to be used. Never use harsh detergents or descalers. Alkaline products such as ammonia, chlorine, bleach, the detergent will damage the protective top coat layer of the Microcement.
