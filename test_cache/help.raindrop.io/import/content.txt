#### How to prepare my own CSV file?[​](https://help.raindrop.io/import/#how-to-prepare-my-own-csv-file "Direct link to How to prepare my own CSV file?")

If you want to upload your own CSV file just make sure:

*   Comma delimited
*   Columns: `url`, `folder`, `title`, `note`, `tags`, `created`
*   `url` column is required, other are optional
*   use `/` to specify nested `folder`, like `a/b/c`
*   to have multiple `tags` just put them in quotes, like `"tag1, tag2"`
*   `created` column should have Unix timestamp or date in ISO 8601 format
*   Column order doesn't matter

Here an example CSV file:

```
folder,url,title,note,tags,created"Folder",http://google.com,Google,"Note","search, app",1629980125"Folder/Nested folder",http://yahoo.com,Yahoo,"Note","search, app",1629980125
```

[Validate your CSV](https://csvlint.io/) file before uploading!

### TXT[​](https://help.raindrop.io/import/#txt "Direct link to TXT")

Txt file should have a url per row

### ENEX (Evernote)[​](https://help.raindrop.io/import/#enex-evernote "Direct link to ENEX (Evernote)")

warning

We only support transferring web clips (notes created using the [Evernote Web Clipper](https://evernote.com/features/webclipper)). Other types of notes, including those containing bunch of links, are not supported.

You can transfer all your web clips (bookmarks) from Evernote to Raindrop.io, including descriptions and tags. To do this, [export your notes from Evernote](https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/209005557-Export-notes-and-notebooks) in the **ENEX** file format.

When exporting, ensure you only select `Created Date`, `Tags`, and `Source URL`, as other fields take up unnecessary space and will be ignored during the import process.

### Pinterest[​](https://help.raindrop.io/import/#pinterest "Direct link to Pinterest")

Pinterest itself doesn't have any tools to export your data. But you can try to use great third-party app called [Pinback](https://pinbackit.github.io/) that can help you download export file. Just follow instructions on [Pinback](https://pinbackit.github.io/) site.

### Edge Collections[​](https://help.raindrop.io/import/#edge-collections "Direct link to Edge Collections")

Go to specific collection, click `... / Copy All` then create a `.txt` file and paste content of clipboard to it. Now you have a `.txt` file that can be imported to Raindrop.

### Pocket, Pinterest, Diigo, Dropmark, GoodLinks, Cubox, Are.na, etc...[​](https://help.raindrop.io/import/#pocket-pinterest-diigo-dropmark-goodlinks-cubox-arena-etc "Direct link to Pocket, Pinterest, Diigo, Dropmark, GoodLinks, Cubox, Are.na, etc...")

You can transfer bookmarks from almost any other service. Simply request an `HTML`, `CSV`, or `JSON` file from service that you use.

Settings[​](https://help.raindrop.io/import/#settings "Direct link to Settings")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you start import, please select how much data you want to transfer:

| Mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Only new folders and bookmarks** | When you upload the same import file again but with new data, this mode will prevent uploading duplicates and ensure structure untouched, only new folders and bookmarks will be imported.If you not sure select this mode
 |
| **Start from scratch** | This mode is the best way to clean your account data completely and replace it with data from import file.  
**Be sure if you already have any data in Raindrop it will be removed and replaced**. |
