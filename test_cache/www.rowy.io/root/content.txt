It begins with your data.  
Rowy displays it directly in a familiar **spreadsheet UI**.

It’s powered by your existing database.  
With over **30 field types**, all your data is accessible.

It’s fully scalable and your data **stays on your cloud project**.

But it’s more than just viewing data.  
With Rowy, you can **write backend logic** right on the same screen.

We’ve done all the boring work for you. So you can focus on writing logic and use **any npm package or API**. No docs or config needed.

It always takes time to get your database ready, populate rich data like adding images, adding multiple tables. It’s never intuitive. I tried Rowy, it’s so damn good and easy.

I highly recommend Rowy. With Algolia and Rowy you can spin up apps with full text search in an hour or two.

Whoa, Rowy looks fantastic! It’s like an open source Airtable, but with a built-in editor for lambda functions that can be run during CRUD operations!

And you can control what data is input with **field validation**, **default values**, and **required fields**.

**Low-code backend in the browser.  
**Experience the modern backend stack.
