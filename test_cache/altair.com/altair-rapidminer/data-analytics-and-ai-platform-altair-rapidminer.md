Scalable, Secure Enterprise Data Analytics and AI Platform with Data Fabric
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We see a future where technical stakeholders have a straight path to building impactful data analytics projects, where non-technical stakeholders can easily access and utilize their organization’s data, and where artificial intelligence (AI) is woven seamlessly into the fabric of the business. We call this marriage of an AI platform with a data fabric an “AI fabric,” and we believe it’s the future of data analytics and AI.

Activate Underutilized Semi-Structured and Unstructured Data
------------------------------------------------------------

To solve complex problems, you need to access data from many sources, including difficult, semi-structured data like PDFs, spreadsheets, and text files. This raw data is rarely clean or fully accurate, so your team needs to transform it for use in machine learning applications.

Whether data is structured or unstructured, on premises or in the cloud, Altair’s solutions can automate preparation and [transform your data](https://altair.com/data-transformation) into clean, accurate datasets in seconds – rather than hours or days.

### A Human's Guide to Generative AI

In this eGuide, we’ll provide a levelheaded, easy-to-understand overview of generative AI technology – what it is, where it came from, how it works, and what it can (and can’t) do. We’ll go over the considerations and responsibilities of any enterprise implementing generative AI, including how to access it, the risks and costs involved, and critically, the tasks at which generative AI excels. We’ll compare generative AI’s strongest use cases to problems that are still better suited to other kinds of machine learning algorithms and outline why it’s important to pick the right tool for the job. Finally, we’ll break down niche use cases industry by industry, highlighting opportunities in each field.

### Break Down Data Science Language Barriers

For developers of analytics and ML tools, free-to-use resources like Python, R, and SQL have redefined the landscape. And this isn't simply a matter of cost. These open-source languages offer greater productivity, flexibility, and their own specific sets of capabilities and benefits. But there's a catch. While it may no longer be the preferred choice for coders who have grown up with open source, the long-established, SAS language remains a staple of the data science ecosystem. As a result, many enterprises still rely on a host of business-critical applications that were built using SAS language.

### Driving Industry 4.0 at Mabe - Altair RapidMiner User Behavior Predictions Help Optimize Appliance Performance

Mabe wanted to leverage historical data from the field to gain new insights into how to optimize the frequency of compressor and air circulation fan operations in its refrigerators to save energy while also keeping food fresh based on how often the door is opened and how long it stays open. Together, Altair and Mabe built an AI workflow in Altair AI Studio that extracts, cleans, prepares, and transforms their data to predict consumer behavior based on the days of the week. Mabe’s engineering team deployed the workflow using Altair AI Hub. Overall, the Altair workflow will help Mabe predict consumer behavior to optimize their refrigerators’ performance and efficiency, ultimately helping customers keep their food fresher for longer.

We’ll go over the considerations and responsibilities of any enterprise implementing generative AI, including how to access it, the risks and costs involved, and critically, the tasks at which generative AI excels. We’ll compare generative AI’s strongest use cases to problems that are still better suited to other kinds of machine learning algorithms and outline why it’s important to pick the right tool for the job. Finally, we’ll break down niche use cases industry by industry, highlighting opportunities in each field.\n\neGuide\n\n![Image 91](https://altair.com/images/default-source/resource-images/altair_eguide_breakdowndatasciencelanguagebarriers_rl_thumbnail_1200x628.jpg?sfvrsn=458ed2b7_1)\n\n### Break Down Data Science Language Barriers\n\nFor developers of analytics and ML tools, free-to-use resources like Python, R, and SQL have redefined the landscape. And this isn't simply a matter of cost. These open-source languages offer greater productivity, flexibility, and their own specific sets of capabilities and benefits. But there's a catch. While it may no longer be the preferred choice for coders who have grown up with open source, the long-established, SAS language remains a staple of the data science ecosystem. As a result, many enterprises still rely on a host of business-critical applications that were built using SAS language.\n\neGuide\n\n![Image 92](https://altair.com/images/default-source/resource-images/mabe_rapidminer_thumbnail_1200x628.jpg?sfvrsn=fd38e671_2)\n\n### Driving Industry 4.0 at Mabe - Altair RapidMiner User Behavior Predictions Help Optimize Appliance Performance\n\nMabe wanted to leverage historical data from the field to gain new insights into how to optimize the frequency of compressor and air circulation fan operations in its refrigerators to save energy while also keeping food fresh based on how often the door is opened and how long it stays open. Together, Altair and Mabe built an AI workflow in Altair AI Studio that extracts, cleans, prepares, and transforms their data to predict consumer behavior based on the days of the week. Mabe’s engineering team deployed the workflow using Altair AI Hub. Overall, the Altair workflow will help Mabe predict consumer behavior to optimize their refrigerators’ performance and efficiency, ultimately helping customers keep their food fresher for longer.\n\nCustomer Stories\n\n### GET IN TOUCH\n\nHow can we help?\n----------------\n\nWe'd love to hear from you.
