[Welcome to Pathway Developer Documentation!](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/introduction/welcome/#welcome-to-pathway-developer-documentation)
=========================================================================================================================================================

Pathway is a Python data processing framework for analytics and AI pipelines over data streams. It's the ideal solution for real-time processing use cases like streaming ETL or RAG pipelines for unstructured data.

![Image 5: Pathway Product overview](https://pathway.com/_ipx/w_2&q_100/assets/content/documentation/products-diag-new.svg)If you are looking for the AI Pipelines, you can find the associated docs [here](https://pathway.com/developers/ai-pipelines/welcome).

#### [Key Features:](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/introduction/welcome/#key-features)

*   **Easy-to-use Python API**: Pathway is fully compatible with Python. Use your favorite Python tools and ML libraries.
*   **Scalable Rust engine**: your Python code is run by a powerful Rust engine with multithreading and multiprocessing. No JVM and no GIL!
*   **Stateful operations**: use stateful and temporal operations such as groupby and windows.
*   **Incremental computations**: using Differential Dataflow, Pathway takes care of out-of-order data points for you, in real time.
*   **Batch and streaming alike**: use the same pipeline on static data and live data streams.
*   **In-memory data processing**: real-time updates, reduced latency, and higher throughput.
*   **Easy to deploy** with Docker or Kubernetes. Pathway comes with an orchestrator and is fully compatible with OpenTelemetry.
*   **Exactly once consistency**: obtain the same results in both batch and streaming.
*   **Persistence and backfilling**: save the state of the computation to quickly resume after a failure or a pipeline update.
*   **LLM tooling**: online ML, RAG pipelines, vector indexes... With Pathway, your ML pipeline works on fresh data.
*   **Connect to any data source**: Pathway comes with 350+ connectors, including SharePoint. Or implement your own.
