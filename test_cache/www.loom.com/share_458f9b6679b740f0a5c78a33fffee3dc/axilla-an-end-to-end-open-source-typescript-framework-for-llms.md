title: Axilla: an end-to-end open source TypeScript framework for LLMs
description: In this video, I introduce Axilla's open-source TypeScript framework for working with LLMs. The first module, axgen, focuses on data loading and retrieval of questions with augmented context. 

Star axgen on github: https://github.com/axilla-io/ax

I will demonstrate a demo UI that showcases the capabilities of this framework, which is fully configurable. We will use GPT4 and ingest the San Francisco Wikipedia page as an example. I will also show you how to ask questions to the LLM, both with and without passing context documents. Join me in exploring this powerful framework!
