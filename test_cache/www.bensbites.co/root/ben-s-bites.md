#### "Ben's Bites has significantly improved my ability to integrate AI tools into my business. There's a community of helpful people with mixed backgrounds and skills, so there's always someone to answer questions. Importantly, the community isn't overwhelming - very easy to jump in and out as you have time and not feel any FOMO."
