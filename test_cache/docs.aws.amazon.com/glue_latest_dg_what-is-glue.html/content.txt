AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easy for analytics users to discover, prepare, move, and integrate data from multiple sources. You can use it for analytics, machine learning, and application development. It also includes additional productivity and data ops tooling for authoring, running jobs, and implementing business workflows.

With AWS Glue, you can discover and connect to more than 70 diverse data sources and manage your data in a centralized data catalog. You can visually create, run, and monitor extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipelines to load data into your data lakes. Also, you can immediately search and query cataloged data using Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Redshift Spectrum.

AWS Glue consolidates major data integration capabilities into a single service. These include data discovery, modern ETL, cleansing, transforming, and centralized cataloging. It's also serverless, which means there's no infrastructure to manage. With flexible support for all workloads like ETL, ELT, and streaming in one service, AWS Glue supports users across various workloads and types of users.

Also, AWS Glue makes it easy to integrate data across your architecture. It integrates with AWS analytics services and Amazon S3 data lakes. AWS Glue has integration interfaces and job-authoring tools that are easy to use for all users, from developers to business users, with tailored solutions for varied technical skill sets.

With the ability to scale on demand, AWS Glue helps you focus on high-value activities that maximize the value of your data. It scales for any data size, and supports all data types and schema variances. To increase agility and optimize costs, AWS Glue provides built-in high availability and pay-as-you-go billing.

**AWS Glue Studio**

AWS Glue Studio is a graphical interface that makes it easy to create, run, and monitor data integration jobs in AWS Glue. You can visually compose data transformation workflows and seamlessly run them on the Apache Spark–based serverless ETL engine in AWS Glue.

With AWS Glue Studio, you can create and manage jobs that gather, transform, and clean data. You can also use AWS Glue Studio to troubleshoot and edit job scripts.

AWS Glue features
-----------------

AWS Glue features fall into three major categories:

*   Discover and organize data
    
*   Transform, prepare, and clean data for analysis
    
*   Build and monitor data pipelines
    

**Discover and organize data**

*   **Unify and search across multiple data stores** – Store, index, and search across multiple data sources and sinks by cataloging all your data in AWS.
    
*   **Automatically discover data** – Use AWS Glue crawlers to automatically infer schema information and integrate it into your AWS Glue Data Catalog.
    
*   **Manage schemas and permissions** – Validate and control access to your databases and tables.
    
*   **Connect to a wide variety of data sources** – Tap into multiple data sources, both on premises and on AWS, using AWS Glue connections to build your data lake.
    

**Transform, prepare, and clean data for analysis**

*   **Visually transform data with a job canvas interface** – Define your ETL process in the visual job editor and automatically generate the code to extract, transform, and load your data.
    
*   **Build complex ETL pipelines with simple job scheduling** – Invoke AWS Glue jobs on a schedule, on demand, or based on an event.
    
*   **Clean and transform streaming data in transit** – Enable continuous data consumption, and clean and transform it in transit. This makes it available for analysis in seconds in your target data store.
    
*   **Deduplicate and cleanse data with built-in machine learning** – Clean and prepare your data for analysis without becoming a machine learning expert by using the `FindMatches` feature. This feature deduplicates and finds records that are imperfect matches for each other.
    
*   **Built-in job notebooks** – AWS Glue job notebooks provide serverless notebooks with minimal setup in AWS Glue so you can get started quickly.
    
*   **Edit, debug, and test ETL code** – With AWS Glue interactive sessions, you can interactively explore and prepare data. You can explore, experiment on, and process data interactively using the IDE or notebook of your choice.
    
*   **Define, detect, and remediate sensitive data** – AWS Glue sensitive data detection lets you define, identify, and process sensitive data in your data pipeline and in your data lake.
    

**Build and monitor data pipelines**

*   **Automatically scale based on workload** – Dynamically scale resources up and down based on workload. This assigns workers to jobs only when needed.
    
*   **Automate jobs with event-based triggers** – Start crawlers or AWS Glue jobs with event-based triggers, and design a chain of dependent jobs and crawlers.
    
*   **Run and monitor jobs** – Run AWS Glue jobs with your choice of engine, Spark or Ray. Monitor them with automated monitoring tools, AWS Glue job run insights, and AWS CloudTrail. Improve your monitoring of Spark-backed jobs with the Apache Spark UI.
    
*   **Define workflows for ETL and integration activities** – Define workflows for ETL and integration activities for multiple crawlers, jobs, and triggers.
