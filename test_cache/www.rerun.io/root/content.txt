The multimodal data stack
-------------------------

Open source log handling and visualization for spatial and embodied AI. Managed infrastructure to ingest, store, analyze, and stream data at scale with built-in visual debugging. Fast, flexible, and easy to use.

[Rerun is open source ![Image 25](blob:https://www.rerun.io/f1f2a9eb0cf2bdc7a47625bb8b2820c4) 6,200](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun)

Start visualizing in seconds
----------------------------

Powerful and flexible visualization for spatial and embodied AI that's shockingly easy to get started with. Simple no sign-up installation and minimal code to get up and running.

```
pip install rerun-sdk
rerun
```

Infrastructure to simplify your data engine
-------------------------------------------

#### Run & record

Run your systems and record data for analysis and training. Use the Rerun SDK to log data or interpret existing log files.

#### Find issues

Use the Rerun viewer to understand behavior and pinpoint issues. Extract signals from logs for further analysis.

#### Improve & deploy

Visualize training and eval, debug prototypes, and extract time aligned training samples from messy logs.

How it works
------------

1

### Model

Use the SDK to model your data and write it to storage or a live viewer. Rerun's data model, a time aware Entity Component System, makes common scenarios simple but is flexible enough to handle custom data.

```
import rerun as rr
rr.init("my_data_generating_application")
rr.connect()  # Connect to a remote viewer
…
rr.log("points", rr.Points3D(positions))
rr.log("camera", rr.Transform3D(pos, rot))
rr.log("camera/image", rr.Pinhole(intrinsics))
rr.log("camera/image", rr.Image(tensor))
rr.log("reprojection_error", rr.Scalar(err))
```

2

### View

Get powerful interactive visualizations of live and recorded data. Time travel through your data, with the industry's fastest multimodal viewer. It's open source and runs both natively and in the browser.

3

### Build

Build layouts and customize visualizations directly through code or interactively in the UI. Build visualization into your tools by embedding the viewer in your Rust, JS, or Gradio apps.

4

### Query

Use Rerun's query APIs to extract time-aligned datasets from messy robotics recordings. Rerun returns Apache Arrow data that plugs in to your favorite dataframe library for further analysis.

```
import rerun as rr
…
# Create an aligned dataframe based on time-points where an Image was logged
aligned_samples = rr.dataframe
    .load_recording("raw.rrd")
    .view(index="sensor_time", contents="/**")
    .filter_is_not_null("/camera/image:ImageBuffer")
    .fill_latest_at()
    .select()

# Write aligned samples to a parquet file for later training
with pq.ParquetWriter("train.parquet", aligned_samples.schema()) as writer:
    for chunk in aligned_samples:
        writer.write_batch(chunk)
```
