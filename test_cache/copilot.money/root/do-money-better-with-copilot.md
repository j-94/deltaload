Downloaded @copilotmoney yesterday and already love it. Have multiple cards connected and it breaks everything down and so easy to use

@copilotmoney is the best money app I‚Äôve ever used!!

@copilotmoney is awesome, clean design and easy to use

Early @copilotmoney user, few apps have become homescreen fixtures so quickly. Go get it!

So good and waaay better than mint!

I was on mint for years, but I‚Äôm so happy I switched. Managing my finances is now fun thanks to Copilot. Amazing app and incredible support team that actually listen to their customers!

The Best Budgeting App!!

Copilot has been a magical experience so far. They‚Äôve innovated the experience of budgeting - it helps keep you informed, but the right things are automatic and effortless. You can choose how manual you‚Äôd like it to be - or how much you‚Äôd like the app to do the work for you. They‚Äôve solved most of the gaps from mint - and it‚Äôs easy to get a budget set up. PFM has been over complicated for too long but Copilot has done a great job of making it easy.

I use @copilotmoney and actually enjoy it. I‚Äôve gotten a few friends hooked too.

Been using @mint for close to a decade and switched to @copilotmoney last week and DAMN.

This IS the move.

I use @copilotmoney and I love it!

Shoutout to @copilotmoney for being so so good. Finally got an app with a dashboard showing me all my accounts in one place.

Amazing Design, Great App to Switch To

I‚Äôve used Mint and Quicken in the past, been somewhat of a power user with Quicken. I love how friendly the iPhone and Mac apps are to use, and how much effort has been spent to get the UX to feel native and clean. They‚Äôre also really quick to roll out new features, which has been awesome to see the app getting constantly better. If you‚Äôre looking for a way to track your spending and budgeting, definitely give this app a try!

Totally worth the subscription!

This app is amazing. I never thought I would be spending money on a budgeting app but this one is worth it! This is a 5/5 app no questions asked! I recommend this to everyone who cares about seeing the big picture with their personal finances.
