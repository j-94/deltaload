##### Description

The Scan-to-BIM Interface is an umbrella component, which is supported by a Graphical User Interface, and merges the Scan-to-BIM sub-components and facilitate the users’ interaction with the Scan-to-BIM Tool. The functionalities provided by the Scan-to-BIM Interface are the following: • Connect to BIMERR Material/MEP database • Run Scan-to-BIM Structural + Scan-to-BIM MEP sub-components • Run Scan-to-BIM Editor • Upload the IFC file to the BIMERR Interoperability Framework These functionalities superseed those of other items in this collection, such as: editMaterials, calculateOpenings, IFCGenerator, and extractStoreys. See readmeInterface.txt for further information on the tool. A more complete documentation is available upon request.
