# WebContainer API Docs


Build the future of web based coding experiences, from interactive tutorials to instant production-ready dev environments.


## Content

**Dev environments.**  
In your **web app.**
--------------------------------------------

From interactive tutorials to full-blown IDEs, build instant, interactive coding experiences backed by WebContainers: the trusted, browser-based runtime from [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/).

[Get started](https://webcontainers.io/guides/introduction)[Book a demo](https://forms.default.com/360757)

### Battle-tested by cutting-edge teams

On the SvelteKit team, we've fantasized for years about being able to build fully interactive learning material for full stack frameworks.**  
With WebContainers it went from 'impossible' to 'easy' almost overnight.**

**As a team working on educational products, StackBlitz WebContainers has been an invaluable tool for us.** The ability to embed full-stack applications with customisable, interactive coding environment directly into our products has greatly enhanced the learning experience for our users.

WebContainers solve the final frontier in JavaScript developer experience - making full-stack Node.js projects run in the browser as lightweight and disposable and secure as frontend REPLs.  
**Every PR, every npm library maintainer, every devtool company with a Node.js SDK, can benefit from this!**

I have worked with Web container API for a couple of weeks at Scrimba to make a pooc of backend support. And I can say it's a solid piece of technology. Things just work, and it's also quite fast. **I'm super excited about the GA since it will unlock so much opportunities for OSS projects and the industry at large.**

**The WebContainer API is a landmark on the way we think docs.** Creating interactive docs and snippets just became so much more feasible! With Server-side code running on the browser, setting up a playground to securely learn Node.js SDKs and compilers became feasible and even fun!

**WebContainers represent a fundamental shift in what is possible in the browser. I'm incredibly excited about the potential this tech unlocks,** from secure, browser-based development environments to highly interactive educational content.

For such a powerful piece of tech I was so impressed by how clear to use the API is. Also running WebContainers inside WebContainers had me ðŸ¤¯

At re:tune, we have been building the missing frontend for GPT-3, on a mission to empower everyone to build AI-first software at the speed of thought. **WebContainers set the stage for our AI-native IDE** - with a copilot that can not only read and write code, but can also understand and operate in the full runtime context across server and client!

Running chess in a terminal, running a terminal in the browser, check mate!  
**The best position to be in is a creative one and the StackBlitz WebContainers allow that.**

#### Full browser support

Run WebContainer in all major browsers, from Chromium-based, to Firefox or Safari TP.

#### All major frameworks

Instantly spin up disposable environments running any major modern framework.

#### Run Wasm out of the box

Port your favorite language or framework to Wasm to run it in WebContainers. Yes, really.

### Set up in only a few steps

### Build rich development experiences not possible before

Interactive tutorials

Learn SvelteKit, a full stack framework, within their custom editor, running on WebContainers, all in the browser.

[learn.svelte.dev](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/introducing-sveltekit)

Low code / no code

A stress-free editor enabling non-technical contributors to make their own PRs with a live, disposable preview to confirm an error-free build.
