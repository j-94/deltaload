### My willingness to learn has enabled me to self teach. In particular I have learned to a high standard architecture software and processes which has been verified by submitting successful planning applications.

After working in the family building business I became interested in the architecture side and self taught architecture software and processes to submit planning application. I worked on a recent project that was submitted to a planning authority for planning approval. I’m very proficent in self learning and can do high level work in a short period of studying the subject through my unique approaches and apptitute to learn.

This will help you understand the process of my recent planning application. I set out surveying the property with a tape however getting a height measurement and more accurate measurements of exteriors I found that the UK government provides opendata [opendata](https://data.gov.uk/), point clouds of Britian. Here is an accurate street scene of my house. ![Image 17: DELL COTTAGE-Street Scene A103](https://images.ctfassets.net/inrfb22ant3x/4ClQyPdiYiAy5ALW7tmSoj/72f775eb7663a319a2d8273221c7af51/DELL_COTTAGE-Street_Scene_A103.jpg)

I then followed the requirements set out by the planning portal as well as looking at examples and sort of reverse engineered a planning application. ![Image 18: DELL COTTAGE-Elevations Proposed A101](https://images.ctfassets.net/inrfb22ant3x/5jzJaCxzBV4API2LfG5Rdn/5bb7aeb2b234c228cfeed6b52b4dc299/DELL_COTTAGE-Elevations_Proposed_A101.jpg)

I then used GCP (google cloud platform) to render some amazing shots of the future development. ![Image 19: 2](https://images.ctfassets.net/inrfb22ant3x/1C573awh3KlkmDKDPvgHZc/cc2cbb62a2da320d748e301814d9e6cc/2.jpg)

> I have an application in the works that uses Ordnance survey LiDAR open data to remotely survey processing data and automatically genenrate a scale representation of development and generate 2D&3D Plans of a site.
