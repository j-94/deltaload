### What they say about Argilla

1.  We have been using Argilla in our research pipelines for quite some time now. It has helped us iterate through our NLP solutions lot more quickly than before because of it"s super intuitive API and user friendly interface. A must have tool.
    
    Ankush Chander
    
    Research Engineer RAx(by Enago)
    
2.  Effectively including the user into the loop is one of the most difficult aspects of Natural Language Processing. I use Argilla specifically for active learning and it has never been easier to set up an active learning application. Keep up the amazing work!
    
    Christopher SchrÃ¶der
    
    NLP Researcher InfAI
    
3.  I've been using Argilla since the v0.2, and it was by far the most suitable and adaptable open source tool for building and improving datasets for our NLP projects. The seamless integration to our existing workflows and pipelines is saving us precious time as we can quickly account for the human feedback in our iterations!
    
    Mahmoud Zyate
    
    Lead Data Scientist Leyton
    
4.  Argilla has helped us to adopt a data-centric approach in our processes to develop and maintain our NLP and ML solutions. We have gained a lot in terms of transparency and efficiency. In-house annotators, data scientists and engineers love it alike. After some time using it, we can't imagine our lives without Argilla!
