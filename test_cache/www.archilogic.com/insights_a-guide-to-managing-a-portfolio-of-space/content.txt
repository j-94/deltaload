Managing Floor Plans with Archilogic
====================================

February 6, 2023

Eliminating the need for traditional document management or specialized CAD and BIM management systems with user-friendly, accessible tools for tracking and managing information about buildings, floors, spaces, and assets.

Managing floor plans can be a challenging task for space occupiers, especially when relying on traditional document management systems or specialized CAD and BIM management systems. These approaches can lead to limited functionality, difficult-to-use systems, and restricted accessibility. Archilogic takes a different approach, turning static floor plans into spatial data stored in a database and made available in the cloud. With Archilogic, space occupiers can easily track and manage information about their buildings, floors, spaces, and assets, and quickly access up-to-date information. Archilogic is user-friendly, doesn't require CAD or BIM expertise, and is compatible with other products and services commonly used by occupiers.

Today’s approaches to managing floor plans
------------------------------------------

**Approach 1: Manage static floor plan files, CAD files, or BIM files using a traditional document management system**

Traditional document management systems can be used to manage a portfolio of floor plans by storing and organizing the physical files in a centralized location. The files can be uploaded and organized into folders, and the system may provide basic tools for searching, sorting, and retrieving files.

In terms of floor plans, this means that the physical files such as CAD or BIM files can be stored in the document management system and organized by project or location. This makes it easier for the relevant team members to access the floor plans and collaborate on any changes that need to be made.

These systems, however, can’t provide the level of functionality required for efficient floor plan management. Here are some of the issues you’ll experience trying to manage a portfolio of floor plans using traditional document management systems:

1.  Limited functionality for handling floor plans specifically.
2.  Information may not be stored in a format that is easily accessible or usable.
3.  Outdated information may not be easily noticeable or resolvable.
4.  Tedious and time-consuming document management.
5.  Information may not be organized in a manner that is easily searchable or retrievable.
6.  Limited compatibility with other products and services commonly used by occupiers.
7.  May not be accessible from different locations or devices.
8.  User experience may not be intuitive or user-friendly for non-technical users.

‍

**Approach 2: Use an official CAD or BIM management system**

Specialized CAD and BIM management systems are designed specifically for managing engineering data and information in the AEC industry. These systems can be used to manage a portfolio of floor plans by providing a centralized repository for storing and organizing floor plan files, along with powerful tools for tracking changes, version control, and collaboration.

While these solutions are much more robust than traditional document management alone, they often fail to satisfy the needs of space occupiers:

1.  These systems can be complex and difficult to use for those without a background in CAD or BIM, meaning only those with specialized expertise can fully utilize the features and capabilities that add value.
2.  Implementing and maintaining a CAD or BIM management system can be expensive, requiring significant resources and investment.
3.  Integrating these systems with existing processes, workflows, and tools is challenging, time-consuming, and often times simply not possible.
4.  Maintaining a CAD or BIM management system can be resource-intensive, requiring ongoing updates and upgrades to keep it functioning optimally.
5.  Accessing the floor plans stored in these systems may require specific hardware and software, which drastically limits accessibility.
6.  These systems are designed for the project team and aren’t designed for the day-to-day reality of space occupiers.

How Archilogic does it differently
----------------------------------

Archilogic turns static floor plans into spatial data that’s stored in a database and made available in the cloud.  Our dashboard gives you the tools you need to track and manage information about every element in your portfolio - from buildings to floors to spaces to assets - and easily surface that information when you need it. As information about the space changes, the changes are stored in the database so that they can be analyzed and when necessary, reverted.  We structure and store information about your space with both occupiers and software developers in mind so that it’s as useful and compatible as possible.

Why Archilogic
--------------

**There are no documents to manage**

This makes it easier to access, share, and update information about your space without the hassle of managing digital documents.

**You always get the most recent, up-to-date information**

Archilogic stores information about your space in a database, so as changes occur, they're immediately reflected in the data. This ensures that you always have the most recent, up-to-date information about your space.

**You can still export information in CAD and BIM formats when you need it**

Despite the benefits of storing floor plans in a database, there may be times when you need to export information in CAD or BIM formats. Archilogic still allows you to do this, so you can share or use the information in a format that works best for you.

**You don’t need CAD or BIM expertise to get the information you need**

Archilogic was designed to be user-friendly and accessible, eliminating the need for specialized CAD or BIM expertise. This makes it easier for you to access the information you need about your space, regardless of your technical background.

**You get a user experience built for the needs of a space occupier, not of the project team**

Unlike CAD or BIM management systems that are designed for the project team, Archilogic was built with the needs of occupiers in mind. This means that you get a user experience that is optimized for your needs, making it easier to access, update, and use information about your space.

**You get useful, compatible digital twins that connect to everything**

Archilogic stores information about your space in a format that is compatible with other products and services you're already using. This makes it easier to connect your space information with the tools you need to work efficiently and effectively.
