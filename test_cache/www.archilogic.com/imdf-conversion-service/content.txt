Platform component

Build apps that understand space at scale

We give service providers the infrastructure they need to deliver products and services that understand floor plans at scale - so they can focus on delivering more value, faster.

Own your digital floor plans and use them everywhere

We give occupiers portfolio-wide control of their space so they can minimize cost, maximize utilization, and create the best possible experiences in their buildings.

Archilogic offers one of the quickest ways to digitize & centralize access to a portfolio of spaces. Add to that the ability to tap into information about each space across multiple locations, and you’ve got an awesome enabler for data-driven space management. As an architect, leveraging this connective approach opens numerous opportunities, from design standards conformity to code compliance reviews.

Archilogic is changing the game for anyone that wants a central place to interact with all the workspaces they own as well as what's in them. Anyone not interested in leveraging this technology to save time and reduce the back and forth with outside service providers may need to have their head examined.

Archilogic was an indispensable partner in data extraction, enabling us to collect the data we needed within just four weeks. Without them, it would have taken us a whole year to obtain the same level of data granularity and quality.
