Does 10Web Booster replace all image optimization, caching and other optimization plugins?

Yes. 10Web Booster is an all-in-one solution for optimizing websites. It implements dozens of speed optimization techniques from simple minification to JS delay and critical CSS generation for frontend optimization and Cloudflare Enterprise CDN for an even faster performance and security. There is no need to run another speed optimization plugin along with 10Web.

![Image 181: Down](https://10web.io/wp-content/themes/10web-theme/images/icons/arrows/grey_arrow.svg) ![Image 182: Up](https://10web.io/wp-content/themes/10web-theme/images/icons/arrows/blue_arrow.svg)

How does image optimization of 10Web Booster work?

Image optimization does several things. First it converts images to WebP format, which drastically reduces the size of your website images, allowing them to quickly load.

Second, it implements container-specific image resizing, which creates small size images and displays them instead of full-size images for visitors using small-screen devices.

Third, image optimization implements lazy-loading and preloading of images, two techniques ensuring fast webpage loading with instant on-demand image display.

On top of that, with Cloudflare’s Mirage optimization, we optimize all images based on device and network connection types for each mobile visitor.

How do I enable Cloudflare Enterprise on 10Web Booster?

From your 10Web Booster dashboard sidebar, go to Cloudflare Enterprise and click ‘Enable’. After that, you’ll be prompted to double check your original server IP, point your domain and configure DNS records as instructed. After your website is verified, Cloudflare Enterprise will show an ‘Active’ status in the ‘Overview’ tab of your dashboard.

First it converts images to WebP format, which drastically reduces the size of your website images, allowing them to quickly load.\n\nSecond, it implements container-specific image resizing, which creates small size images and displays them instead of full-size images for visitors using small-screen devices.\n\nThird, image optimization implements lazy-loading and preloading of images, two techniques ensuring fast webpage loading with instant on-demand image display.\n\nOn top of that, with Cloudflare’s Mirage optimization, we optimize all images based on device and network connection types for each mobile visitor.\n\n![Image 183: Down](https://10web.io/wp-content/themes/10web-theme/images/icons/arrows/grey_arrow.svg) ![Image 184: Up](https://10web.io/wp-content/themes/10web-theme/images/icons/arrows/blue_arrow.svg)\n\nHow do I enable Cloudflare Enterprise on 10Web Booster?\n\nFrom your 10Web Booster dashboard sidebar, go to Cloudflare Enterprise and click ‘Enable’.
