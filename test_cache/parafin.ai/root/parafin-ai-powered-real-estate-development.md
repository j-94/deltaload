quicker than brewing a cup of coffee

"Parafin is a must-have tool! Generating a feasibility report is quicker than brewing a cup of coffee. With the time and effort saved, we can look at more deals and widen our development opportunities."

the pivot to LivSmart Studios by Hilton was instantaneous

"A franchise opportunity didn't materialize for another brand on a site we were pursuing. But since the project was already in Parafin, the pivot to LivSmart Studios by Hilton was instantaneous."

In today’s environment, quick decisions are vital

"Parafin is disruptive in my world. Instead of needing weeks of back-and-forth with architects and analysts, Parafin can quickly size up an opportunity for a critical quick decision on whether to continue pursuit or punt. And in today’s environment, quick decisions are vital."

I can even consider brands we haven’t built before

"Parafin allows quick programming analysis for potential hotel development sites. It has multiple brand layouts that provide test fitting a site which limits lead time and up-front design cost with an architect. I can quickly see how alternative brands might fit on our sites, and even consider brands we haven’t built before."

great resource for analyzing a site in the early stages

"In our fast-paced development world, we must make decisions quickly. We obviously rely upon our architects to thoroughly design our hotels, but we have found Parafin to be a great resource for analyzing a site in the early stages."

instant turnaround... It’s a win-win

"Early in our process, Parafin provides us a very sophisticated ability to work side-by-side with our developers to optimize designs for their sites.  
It’s a win-win – they get instant turnaround with smart, visual data, and we come away with a high-quality head-start on the design without weeks of back-and-forth."
