Did you know there's a growing list of over 100 free tools to help you do your job? Unlike proprietary software, free software will never make your digital work incompatible, obsolete, or force you into subscriptions. See the AECO Free Software Directory.

Begin your journey:

Switch to QCAD and LibreCAD for 2D CAD drafting instead of depending on AutoCAD
Learn OpenBIM authoring with The Bonsai Add-on (formerly known as BlenderBIM) Add-on
Learn solid 3D modeling and BIM model creation with FreeCAD
Learn structural analysis with_Code Aster
Learn about environmental analysis

Join us on the forum so we can start these pages together:

Learn 2D architectural visualisation with Krita and The GIMP instead of Photoshop
Learn freeform 3D modeling and visualisation with Blender
Learn lighting simulation with Radiance
Learn geospatial analysis with QGIS
Manage a project with OpenProject
Get started with OpenStreetMaps for open GIS data

Do you want to dig deep in to AEC tech?
