**Important notes:**

*   License activation: Make sure your license is activated to see the upgrade/downgrade option
    
*   Upgrade/Downgrade restrictions: Once a deal has sold out on the AppSumo marketplace, you can only downgrade as no additional licensing tiers are available for purchase
    
*   Time frame: Downgrades can only be requested within 60 days of your original purchase
    

How to cancel or request refund from AppSumo?

*   Select refund reason: Choose your refund reason and click the blue “Continue” button

*   Assistance: If you encounter any issues, you can reach out to AppSumo’s support team at [support@appsumo.com](https://intercom.help/SaveDay-HelpCenter/en/articles/9661463-saveday-lifetime-deal-on-appsumo)​ or check out AppSumo Help Center at: [https://help.appsumo.com/](https://help.appsumo.com/)
    

Rules for buying plans on AppSumo and SaveDay

If you already have a SaveDay plan and then buy a plan from AppSumo, or vice versa, here’s how it works:

1.  **Updating your plan when switching between SaveDay and AppSumo**
    

*   If you purchase a plan from SaveDay first and then buy a plan from AppSumo, the AppSumo plan will apply immediately
    
*   If you purchase a plan from AppSumo first and then buy a plan from SaveDay, the SaveDay plan will apply immediately. Once the SaveDay plan is successfully canceled, you will revert to the AppSumo lifetime deal
    

**2\. Managing plans when both SaveDay and AppSumo packages are purchased**

*   If the latest purchase is from AppSumo:
    
    *   If you renew your SaveDay plan after cancelling it within the billing cycle, the SaveDay plan will take effect right away
        
    *   If you cancel the AppSumo plan and ask for a refund, you can keep using the SaveDay plan until the current billing cycle ends, as long as you're still within that cycle with SaveDay
        

*   If the latest purchase is from SaveDay:
    
    *   If you cancel your SaveDay plan, at the end of the billing cycle, you will revert to the AppSumo plan
        

**Note:**

*   When you already have a plan on SaveDay and then buy a plan on AppSumo, you need to cancel the SaveDay plan to avoid being charged for parallel plans from both SaveDay and AppSumo
    
*   Parallel usage of both plans simultaneously is not allowed
