[@pipedream](https://twitter.com/pipedream) is like Zapier ‚ö°Ô∏èbut for programmers. I‚Äôve been using it to tie some work logic together with python scripts and it‚Äôs SUPER handy üëç

This one was fun as hell to set up üëè and I can't believe I didn't know @pipedream allows for code snippets as workflow steps. Can't wait to play around with that some more
