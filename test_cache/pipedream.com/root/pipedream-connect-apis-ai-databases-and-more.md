[@pipedream](https://twitter.com/pipedream) is like Zapier ‚ö°Ô∏èbut for programmers. I‚Äôve been using it to tie some work logic together with python scripts and it‚Äôs SUPER handy üëç

@pipedream for API orchestration and many more

@NotionHQ as a Work OS

@OpenAI for Chat API

No-code all the way!

We‚Äôve built an MVP for @texteroai using @weweb\_io

@supabase and @pipedream.

And it gives us $13k+ MRR

Oh, postman is helping me so much to prepare the structure before sending the actual request.

I also use [@pipedream](https://twitter.com/pipedream) to catch the requests I am sending out from the app üòÄ

Pipedream is dope ‚Äì and enables some complex logic that's impossible with Make etc.

This one was fun as hell to set up üëè and I can't believe I didn't know @pipedream allows for code snippets as workflow steps. Can't wait to play around with that some more

My stack for staying on top of user feedback while building @TallyForms

@pipedream and of course, @useLookup break it down

Connect APIs, AI, databases, and more.
