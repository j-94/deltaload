**Neo4j Browser**

Neo4j Browser is a developer-focused tool that allows you to execute Cypher queries and visualize the results. It is the default developer interface for both Enterprise and Community editions of Neo4j. It comes out-of-the-box with all of Neo4j’s graph database offerings, including Neo4j Server (Community and Enterprise editions), Neo4j AuraDB (Neo4j’s Database as a Service), and Neo4j Desktop (all OS versions).

Neo4j Browser is suitable for running ad-hoc graph queries, with the appropriate ability to prototype a Neo4j-based application.

Neo4j Browser is a tool for developers to interact with the graph, with the main focus on:

*   Writing and running graph queries with Cypher.
    
*   Exportable, tabular results of any query result.
    
*   Used for graph visualization of query results containing nodes and relationships.
