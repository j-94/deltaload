> “This method of designing icons is genius. I wish I had known this method a lot sooner.”

**Stacey Solomon**, Founder at Retail Park

A book and video course that teaches you how to design your own icons from scratch.

“Everything Starts as a Square” is a book and video course that teaches you a simple method to designing icons that anyone can learn.

Before I learned how to design icons myself, I always imagined that they were drawn by hand using the pen tool, some sort of fancy graphics tablet, and hours and hours spent manually fine-tuning bezier curves.

But it turns out this isn’t how great icon designers work at all.

In “Everything Starts as a Square”, you’ll learn the systems experts use to create pixel perfect icons, without relying on a steady hand.

*   Using boolean operations to combine basic shapes into complex icons
*   How to adapt icons to different sizes
*   Translating icons from an outline style to a solid style
*   Identifying the characteristics that make an icon set cohesive
*   Figma features and keyboard shortcuts to speed up your workflow

By the end of the book, you’ll have all the confidence you need to dig in and start creating beautiful icons that can hold their own against any of the sets you can find online.

I’ve been designing icons professionally for over a decade and have worked with dozens of the biggest brands to create custom sets for their products. I’m an accomplished conference speaker, and have been teaching icon design workshops every month for the last three years. I’ve worked with designers of all skill levels and honed my way of teaching to really click for anyone who has the itch to start designing their own icons.
