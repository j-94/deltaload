The goal of Tokin is to find the internet's best videos.

We think there's a difference between videos people **watch**, and videos people **love**.

How does it work?
-----------------

Award your Tokins to the best videos you find on the platform, or use them to Nominate a video.

Over time, the best videos on the internet will rise to the top!

What is a Tokin?
----------------

Think of them as a "love" metric, or a currency of quality.

You receive 3 Tokins per day.

Tokins can not be bought or sold. They replenish everyday at 8PM EDT.

What is a [Nomination](https://tokin.tv/nominate)?
--------------------------------------------------

Posting your favorite videos for the world to see!

You'll get credit for each Tokin your nominated video receives.

**This will be reflected in your Curator Score**

Curator Score?
--------------

A running count of how many Tokins your nominated videos have received.

Post absolute bangers and climb the Curator leaderboard!

Have fun and let us know what you think
