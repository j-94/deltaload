GitAgent: Facilitating Autonomous Agent with GitHub by Tool Extension

While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in natural language processing, their efficacy in addressing complex, multifaceted tasks remains limited. A growing area of research focuses on LLM-based agents equipped with external tools capable of performing diverse tasks. However, existing LLM-based agents only support a limited set of tools which is unable to cover a diverse range of user queries, especially for those involving expertise domains. It remains a challenge for LLM-based agents to extend their tools autonomously when confronted with various user queries. As GitHub has hosted a multitude of repositories which can be seen as a good resource for tools, a promising solution is that LLM-based agents can autonomously integrate the repositories in GitHub according to the user queries to extend their tool set. In this paper, we introduce GitAgent, an agent capable of achieving the autonomous tool extension from GitHub. GitAgent follows a four-phase procedure to incorporate repositories and it can learn human experience by resorting to GitHub Issues/PRs to solve problems encountered during the procedure. Experimental evaluation involving 30 user queries demonstrates GitAgent's effectiveness, achieving a 69.4% success rate on average.
