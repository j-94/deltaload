Text based Large Language Model for Recommendation
Jianchao Ji, Zelong Li, Shuyuan Xu, Wenyue Hua, Yingqiang Ge, Juntao Tan, Yongfeng Zhang
In recent years, large language models (LLM) have emerged as powerful tools for diverse natural language processing tasks. However, their potential for recommendation systems remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents an innovative approach to recommendation systems using large language models (LLMs) based on text data. In this paper, we present a novel text-based large language model for recommendation (TBLLMR) that utilized the expressive power of LLM to generate personalized recommendation. TBLLMR uses LLM's understanding ability to interpret context, learn user preferences, and generate relevant recommendation. Our proposed approach leverages the vast knowledge encoded in large language models to accomplish recommendation tasks. We first we formulate specialized prompts to enhance the ability of LLM to comprehend recommendation tasks. Subsequently, we use these prompts to fine-tune the model on a dataset of user-item interactions, represented by textual data, to capture user preferences and item characteristics. Our research underscores the potential of text-based LLMs in revolutionizing the domain of recommendation systems and offers a foundational framework for future explorations in this field. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, and the experiments shows that our TBLLMR has significant better results on large dataset.
