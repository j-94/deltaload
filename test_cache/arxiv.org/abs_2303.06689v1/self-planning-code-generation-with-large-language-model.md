Self-planning Code Generation with Large Language Model
Xue Jiang, Yihong Dong, Lecheng Wang, Qiwei Shang, Ge Li
Although large language models have demonstrated impressive ability in code generation, they are still struggling to address the complicated intent provided by humans. It is widely acknowledged that humans typically employ planning to decompose complex problems and schedule the solution steps prior to implementation. Thus we introduce planning into code generation to help the model understand complex intent and reduce the difficulty of problem solving. This paper proposes a self-planning code generation method with large language model, which consists of two phases, namely planning phase and implementation phase. Specifically, in the planning phase, the language model plans out the solution steps from the intent combined with in-context learning. Then it enters the implementation phase, where the model generates code step by step, guided by the solution steps. The effectiveness of self-planning code generation has been rigorously evaluated on multiple code generation datasets and the results have demonstrated a marked superiority over naive direct generation approaches with language model. The improvement in performance is substantial, highlighting the significance of self-planning in code generation tasks.
