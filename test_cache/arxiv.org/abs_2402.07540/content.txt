PKG API: A Tool for Personal Knowledge Graph Management

Personal knowledge graphs (PKGs) offer individuals a way to store and consolidate their fragmented personal data in a central place, improving service personalization while maintaining full user control. Despite their potential, practical PKG implementations with user-friendly interfaces remain scarce. This work addresses this gap by proposing a complete solution to represent, manage, and interface with PKGs. Our approach includes (1) a user-facing PKG Client, enabling end-users to administer their personal data easily via natural language statements, and (2) a service-oriented PKG API. To tackle the complexity of representing these statements within a PKG, we present an RDF-based PKG vocabulary that supports this, along with properties for access rights and provenance.
