[MyThorch -------- MyThorch is a revolutionary document interaction app that leverages user behavior to embed vectors and store them in a Redis vector database. This process creates a long-term memory AI that truly understands the user's needs and preferences, leading to a highly efficient reading experience. The user uploads documents and the app filters for key points and also provide content the user cares about. The user can then select any part of the document to clarify further and track down references for specific parts of the generated document, ensuring accuracy and avoiding AI hallucinations. Using React for the frontend and Flask for the backend, we deliver a fast and efficient user experience. The GPT-3 API generates personalized documents based on user focus, while Redis stores previous interactions to reduce token input to GPT-3. Constant data collection helps us adapt to the user's needs for a personalized experience. Future plans include integration with Kindle, Kobo, Google, and Firefox, as well as partnerships with document management systems and cloud storage platforms. Our subscription-based business model offers premium features for $2/month.

[BiteBuddy Meal Planner ---------------------- BiteBuddy is a meal-planning tool that is prized for its customization. What this entails is that for every different user, a different meal plan is generated based on the user's preferences, needs, and dislikes. A tool to create a meal plan needs to understand what the customer needs. Therefore, the tool asks the user about their body characteristics to help organize the facts needed to create a balanced diet. Precisely, the user's Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated to give an idea about the possible goals and hence, display an adequate diet. After that, the tool asks the user about any allergies, if any exist, so as not to include these foods in the plan. Moreover, they are asked to input any preferences they might have to include in their diet. The user input is then processed to generate the data. After which, the data is sent via the APIs through properly formatted prompts. The generated meal plan is then displayed in table format for every day of the week and at least three meals per day. Each meal has its nutritional values displayed, including carbohydrates, calories, fats, and proteins; the tool also suggests the right portions and the recipe with the ingredients that aid in preparing that meal. The recipe sub-window also illustrates the meal by providing a photo. Sorting is a feature that can be used to sort the meals based on their nutritional facts. The main advantage of this website is that it groups everything that the user might need to plan a healthy diet, considering their allergies and any food preferences they might have for the week. The tool replaces the need to visit nutritionists and explore different food regimes. It also replaces searching and exploring various recipes among multiple cooking platforms.](https://lablab.ai/event/openai-hackathon/the-decoders/bitebuddy-personal-meal-planner-and-chat-bot)

[AI Home Design -------------- AI Home Design is an interior design assistant powered by Stable Diffusion and YOLO to solve pain points felt by homeowners. It differs from other AI interior design apps out there because 1) it addresses pain points in homeowners' entire user journey, 2) functions as a social sharing platform, and 3) is an aide to augment, not replace home decor professionals and designers. FIRSTLY, the flagship "Create With AI" feature guides the user in prompt engineering to convert their design hunches from text to actual image, helping them overcome creative blockages. This also improves communication with interior designers, since words can be subjective, but images are direct. SECONDLY, homeowners may want to reimagine a space even after initial fittings like paneling and paint jobs are already done. They cannot tear down these fittings in real life, but they can use Stable Diffusion's image-to-image functionality to reimagine the space. THIRD, AI Home Design also functions as a social sharing platform where users can draw inspiration and start conversations with one another. FINALLY, homeowners still need to furnish and populate their spaces even after they have decided on their designs. This is where YOLO comes in, helping the user to recognise objects, and creating outbound e-commerce links for them to buy items. AI is thus used here to smoothen homeowner-professional interactions and engender connections. Even after the hackathon, I am continually improving the app by creating new features (see slide deck!), such as tools to facilitate discussions, recommenders, or improved object detection. On the technical front, I aim to infuse more powerful models like CLIP, Segment Anything or YOLOv8. On the business front, I am building in-app services to serve new target groups like real estate agents and elder-friendly/disability-friendly retrofitting specialists. Join me on this journey to make interior design more seamless for users, and to use AI in a coherent, impactful way.
