### What is Html to Pug

This project combines multiple open source projects to create a simple user interface for web developers that are using pug in their web projects. We're using "Bootstrap" as base template using a free "Boostwatch" template. The code-editors are based on "Ace" and the backend is running "html2pug" and "html2jade" plugins to convert your html content to pug syntax. You find a list of included projects/licenses [here](https://html-to-pug.com/licenses.html).

### What is Pug

"Pugjs is a high performance template engine heavily influenced by Haml and implemented with JavaScript for Node.js and browsers. For bug reports, feature requests and questions, open an issue. For discussion join the chat room."

\-- quote from github.com/pugjs/pug community

### What about Jade

Jade has been renamed to pug due to copyright conflicts. "Jade is a high performance template engine heavily influenced by Haml and implemented with JavaScript for node and browsers." [Source](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jade)

### How to use this tool

Our Html to Pug realtime converter does all the work for you. If you have a html snippet simply paste it into the left editor. Our backend will perform the conversation from html to pug styled syntax and print the pug output in the right editor.
