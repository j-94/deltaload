Prisma has a low learning curve. Productivity becomes higher because it gets combined with end-to-end type-safety using TypeScript.

Accelerate is a perfect fit for landing pages. We take advantage of caching to speed up queries and reduce latency, making them lightning-fast. This means we have a faster landing page, leading to better conversion.

I love how Prisma makes my life as a developer so easy. The TypeScript autocompletion is the best I've used, having tried many different ORMs. The migrations are a breeze.

What I love most about Postiz is Prisma. It lets me switch between SQL databases effortlessly. I've used other ORMs before such as Eloquent (Laravel), but nothing matches Prisma's typing and features!

Prisma's typesafe SQL is a great feature. It fills a great abstraction gap that existed prior to this. Earlier, I would have to fall back straight to pgtyped.

Prisma helps us **unify data access** from multiple enterprise systems into a single API. It means we can move very quickly whilst staying flexible.

Prisma has a low learning curve. Productivity becomes higher because it gets combined with end-to-end type-safety using TypeScript.

Prisma Accelerate handled 670,000+ webhooks from Shopify when the orders webhook from 2022/23 was fired, which cost us about $11.

Not bad for accidentally being DDoS'd to a Heroku Postgres instance with **zero downtime**, and all the entries made it through.

Accelerate is a perfect fit for landing pages. We take advantage of caching to speed up queries and reduce latency, making them lightning-fast. This means we have a faster landing page, leading to better conversion.
