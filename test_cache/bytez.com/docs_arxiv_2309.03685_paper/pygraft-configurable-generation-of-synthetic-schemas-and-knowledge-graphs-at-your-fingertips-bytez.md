title: PyGraft: Configurable Generation of Synthetic Schemas and Knowledge Graphs at Your Fingertips | Bytez
description: PyGraft is a new software tool that helps create fake but realistic datasets called knowledge graphs (KGs) and schemas. These KGs represent information in a structured way, similar to how Google uses data to answer questions. Researchers can use PyGraft to easily generate different types of KGs on their computer, which is useful when real data is hard to find, especially in sensitive areas like medicine or education. By allowing users to customize what they want, PyGraft helps improve tests and evaluations of new computer programs that work with KGs.
