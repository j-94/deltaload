title: In-Context Learning for Extreme Multi-Label Classification | Bytez
description: The researchers propose a program called Infer-Retrieve-Rank (IReRa) to solve a challenging problem called extreme multi-label classification (XMC). XMC involves assigning multiple labels to a document from a very large set of possible labels. The program combines different components, including language models and retrievers, to make accurate predictions. The researchers optimize this program using a small amount of labeled data and achieve state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. The program is easily adaptable to new tasks, requires minimal prompt engineering, and can work with only a few labeled examples.
