**What are Google Ads and Are They for You?**
---------------------------------------------

Google Ads are the lifeblood of many small businesses' marketing efforts. They drive customers to your business right away, and unlike SEO, the results can be visible in as soon as a few weeks. If your business sees traffic come in through Google, trying Google Ads is a worthwhile investment. They are incredibly easy to try and should at least be something you test to see if they work for your business.

While Google Ads have the potential to transform your business, they can be extremely complicated to run. Setting up campaigns, creating ad sets, A/B testing ads, choosing keywords, and selecting the right type of Google Ads and audience are all tedious tasks. Paying someone else to manage this for you can cost thousands per month on top of the ad spend.
