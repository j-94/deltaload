This is achieved through accelerators like pre-built connectors for 1000+ SaaS, on-prem databases, ERP and more; 400,000+ ready-to-use recipes for common business processes shared by 70,000+ community members. A fully cloud-native architecture that is built for scale and speed significantly reduces operational footprint and overall costs.

    In Workato, recipes are automations for business processes. They are a set of workflows that help connect your business applications. Coupled with many other advanced features, Workato recipes are able to handle all app integration and workflow automation scenarios ranging from simple to complex.
    
*   #### What is a connector?
    
    Workato connectors secure access to your business applications.

    Any page of your customer's tenant can be dropped into a secure iframe should you want to build a full in-app automation experience. Workato also provides an authentication widget iframe for secure third-party credential collection to any workato connector. In addition, we have a full suite of APIs to build other UX flows to meet your product needs.
