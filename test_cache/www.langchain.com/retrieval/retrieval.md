# Retrieval


With LangChain’s ingestion and retrieval methods, developers can easily augment the LLM’s knowledge with company data, user information, and other private sources.


## Content

With LangChain’s built-in ingestion and retrieval methods, developers can augment the LLM’s knowledge with company or user data.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A complete set    
of RAG building blocks
-----------------------------------------

Build best-in-class RAG systems with LangChain's comprehensive integrations, state-of-the-art techniques, and infinite composability.

[See Integrations](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/)

The data connections and infrastructure you need for your retrieval use-case
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

LangChain offers an extensive library of off-the-shelf tools and an intuitive framework for customizing your own.

Document loaders  for any type of data.
---------------------------------------

### Retrieval algorithms that provide greater precision and results

Self Query Retriever

This retriever inspects the natural language query and writes a structured query to run on the underlying VectorStore.

Contextual Compression

Compress the retrieved document using the context of the query, so that only the relevant information  in the source is returned.

Multi Vector Retriever

This retriever lets you query across multiple stored vectors per document, including ones on smaller chunks, summaries, and hypothetical questions.

Time-Weighted Vector Store

Combine semantic similarity with  a time decay to factor in recency  in your retrieval.

Parent Document Retriever

Embed small chunks, which are better for similarity search, but retrieve larger chunks, which help with generation.
