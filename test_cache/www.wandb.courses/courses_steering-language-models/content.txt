### Jason Liu

#### Independent Consultant

Jason is currently on sabbatical at South Park Commons, where he consults and advises fast-growing startups on applied AI and tech strategy. Before, he spent time at Stitchfix building out vision capabilities for e-commerce and developing frameworks to design and instrument recommendation systems. Now, between consulting and open-source work, he is interested in finding new ergonomics for LLMs, making them less mystical and more integrated with traditional workflows.
