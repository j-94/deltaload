Feature Extraction from Engineering Drawings with AI
----------------------------------------------------

Powered by AI, Werk24's API reads Engineering Drawings and returns a JSON response with structured information, including Title Blocks (Drawing ID, Designation, Material, General Tolerance), Measures, Tolerances, Thread, Chamfer, GD&T, Radii and Surface Roughness.

Technical capabilities
----------------------

Werk24's TechRead API utilizes Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision to extract key information locked in scanned Technical Drawings. Unlike traditional OCR solutions, our technology can understand great amount of contextual information and convert it into structured and searchable digital repositories.

![Image 46: Werk24 explains technical capabilities: Access Title Block](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/606a05e6a354bb41c205b148/1617629149425-HSGHAC4HEV8HIH6GWAM2/Artboard+1+copy+8.png)

### Access Title Block

Werk24’s API reads the non-standardized Title Block and translates its content into a structured machine-readable format. Unlike OCR, Werk24’s AI interprets the content even when captions are missing or located in another cell.

![Image 47: Werk24 explains technical capabilities: Extract Measures](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/606a05e6a354bb41c205b148/1617632975687-S3CR8UCOHXZDVHF3J3BC/Artboard+1+copy+7.png)

### Extract Measures

Werk24’s AI extracts Measures and converts them into a standard data structure, allowing direct access to Nominal Size, Tolerance (Fit & Deviation), Thread and Chamfer information. It’s way beyond traditional OCR solutions that only returns unstructured Strings.

![Image 48: Werk24 explains technical capabilities: Capture GD&Ts](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/606a05e6a354bb41c205b148/1617636253010-ZGISJVFG6V9I4FXDK9R3/Artboard+1+copy+10.png)

### Capture GD&Ts

Our API captures the full range of Geometric Dimensioning and Toleration (GD&T) frames on drawings and returns them in a standard data model. You can directly access the characteristic, toleration and reference data.

![Image 49: Werk24 explains technical capabilities: Create Thumbnails](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/606a05e6a354bb41c205b148/1617623067411-3GRIRXMVIG48LDM4BBI1/Artboard+1+copy.png)

### Create Thumbnails

Separating Sectional Views can be challenging, especially when they are positioned very close to one another. TechRead API separates them and generates thumbnails for individual Sectionals, as well as the whole drawing.
