What is Automated Machine Learning?
-----------------------------------

Machine learning is the foundational element of artificial intelligence (AI) and uses [algorithms](https://h2o.ai/wiki/machine-learning-algorithms) to detect and extract patterns in data to [predict](https://h2o.ai/wiki/prediction) certain outcomes based on that analysis.

Automated machine learning ([autoML](https://h2o.ai/wiki/automated-machine-learning/)) systematically addresses multiple steps of the data science lifecycle with automation designed to reduce complexity across tasks and empower data scientists to implement AI projects with higher accuracy more efficiently. AutoML also improves accessibility to machine learning capabilities for those without expertise in [data science](https://h2o.ai/wiki/data-science/) by providing user-friendly interfaces that anyone with beginner technical knowledge can use, enabling business users and IT professionals to easily implement machine learning into their daily workflows.

H2O Driverless AI

Democratizing AI Adoption with AutoML
-------------------------------------

As organizations look to streamline decision making and improve customer experiences with AI, they are running into three core challenges of talent, time, and trust. There is not enough data science talent to build every use case by hand, and even with the right people, hand-coding is time intensive, difficult to replicate and subject to many errors. Each model developed must then be explained and validated by the business so users can trust the decisions provided by the model. H2O Driverless AI automates many core data science tasks, while automatically documenting the model development process and providing machine learning interpretability for all models in production. With the addition of an AI Wizard that provides proactive data science guidance, more people across all business functions can now build machine learning models, removing barriers to machine learning literacy and understanding and, ultimately, increasing accessibility to AI technologies.

directly from our customers.\n\n##### Rajesh Malla, Head of Data Engineering at Resolution Life insurance, takes the stage at H2O World Sydney 2022 to discuss AI transformation and how Resolution Life uses H2O Driverless AI to predict claim triage and other insurance AI use cases.\n\n[Watch Video](https://h2o.ai/resources/video/h2o-world-sydney-ai-in-insurance)\n\nWhat is Automated Machine Learning?\n-----------------------------------\n\nMachine learning is the foundational element of artificial intelligence (AI) and uses [algorithms](https://h2o.ai/wiki/machine-learning-algorithms) to detect and extract patterns in data to [predict](https://h2o.ai/wiki/prediction) certain outcomes based on that analysis.\n\nAutomated machine learning ([autoML](https://h2o.ai/wiki/automated-machine-learning/)) systematically addresses multiple steps of the data science lifecycle with automation designed to reduce complexity across tasks and empower data scientists to implement AI projects with higher accuracy more efficiently. AutoML also improves accessibility to machine learning capabilities for those without expertise in [data science](https://h2o.ai/wiki/data-science/) by providing user-friendly interfaces that anyone with beginner technical knowledge can use, enabling business users and IT professionals to easily implement machine learning into their daily workflows.\n\nH2O Driverless AI\n-----------------\n\nDelivers industry leading autoML capabilities specifically designed to use AI to make AI, with automation encompassing data science best practices across key functional areas like data visualization, feature engineering, model development and validation, model documentation, machine learning interpretability and more.\n\n ![Image 101](https://h2o.ai/platform/ai-cloud/make/h2o-driverless-ai/_jcr_content/root/container/section_1746590474/par/advancedcolumncontro_1539400920/columns0/advancedcolumncontro/columns0/image.coreimg.png/1711389427526/feature-transformation-small-3x.png) ![Image 102](https://h2o.ai/platform/ai-cloud/make/h2o-driverless-ai/_jcr_content/root/container/section_1746590474/par/advancedcolumncontro_1539400920/columns0/advancedcolumncontro/columns0/image.coreimg.png/1711389427526/feature-transformation-small-3x.png)\n\n### Intelligent feature transformation\n\nH2O Driverless AI automates the entire [feature engineering](https://h2o.ai/wiki/feature-engineering) process to include detecting relevant features in a given dataset, finding the interactions within those features, handling missing values, deriving new features from data, comparing the existing and the newly generated features and showing the relative importance of each of these features. Features are transformed into meaningful values that machine learning algorithms can easily consume.\n\n ![Image 103](https://h2o.ai/platform/ai-cloud/make/h2o-driverless-ai/_jcr_content/root/container/section_1746590474/par/advancedcolumncontro_1539400920/columns1/advancedcolumncontro/columns0/image.coreimg.png/1711389427712/machine-learning-small-3x.png) ![Image 104](https://h2o.ai/platform/ai-cloud/make/h2o-driverless-ai/_jcr_content/root/container/section_1746590474/par/advancedcolumncontro_1539400920/columns1/advancedcolumncontro/columns0/image.coreimg.png/1711389427712/machine-learning-small-3x.png)\n\n### Automated model development\n\nReducing the time that it takes to develop accurate, production-ready models is critical to delivering AI at scale.

Deploy\n\nWith H2O Driverless AI, models can be deployed automatically across a number of environment choices including creating a REST endpoint for any web applications to invoke the model, automatically run as a service in the cloud, or simply as a highly optimized Java code for edge devices.\n\nDemocratizing AI Adoption with AutoML\n-------------------------------------\n\nAs organizations look to streamline decision making and improve customer experiences with AI, they are running into three core challenges of talent, time, and trust. There is not enough data science talent to build every use case by hand, and even with the right people, hand-coding is time intensive, difficult to replicate and subject to many errors. Each model developed must then be explained and validated by the business so users can trust the decisions provided by the model. H2O Driverless AI automates many core data science tasks, while automatically documenting the model development process and providing machine learning interpretability for all models in production. With the addition of an AI Wizard that provides proactive data science guidance, more people across all business functions can now build machine learning models, removing barriers to machine learning literacy and understanding and, ultimately, increasing accessibility to AI technologies.\n\n ![Image 112](https://h2o.ai/platform/ai-cloud/make/h2o-driverless-ai/_jcr_content/root/container/section_798744964/par/advancedcolumncontro_785320959/columns0/image.coreimg.png/1711389429116/persona-data-2x.png) ![Image 113](https://h2o.ai/platform/ai-cloud/make/h2o-driverless-ai/_jcr_content/root/container/section_798744964/par/advancedcolumncontro_785320959/columns0/image.coreimg.png/1711389429116/persona-data-2x.png)\n\n### Data Scientists\n\n#### Make highly accurate machine learning models with speed and transparency to accelerate the implementation of analytic initiatives.\n\nH2O Driverless AI empowers data scientists to work on projects faster and more efficiently by using automation to accomplish key machine learning tasks in just minutes or hours, not months.
