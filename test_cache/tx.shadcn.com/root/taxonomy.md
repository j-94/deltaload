An open source application built using the new router, server components and everything new in Next.js 13.


## Content

[Follow along on Twitter](https://twitter.com/shadcn)

An example app built using Next.js 13 server components.
--------------------------------------------------------

I'm building a web app with Next.js 13 and open sourcing everything. Follow along as we figure this out together.

Features
--------

This project is an experiment to see how a modern app, with features like auth, subscriptions, API routes, and static pages would work in Next.js 13 app dir.

### Next.js 13

App dir, Routing, Layouts, Loading UI and API routes.

### React 18

Server and Client Components. Use hook.

### Database

ORM using Prisma and deployed on PlanetScale.

### Components

UI components built using Radix UI and styled with Tailwind CSS.

### Authentication

Authentication using NextAuth.js and middlewares.

### Subscriptions

Free and paid subscriptions using Stripe.

Taxonomy also includes a blog and a full-featured documentation site built using Contentlayer and MDX.

Proudly Open Source
-------------------

Taxonomy is open source and powered by open source software.  
The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/shadcn/taxonomy).
