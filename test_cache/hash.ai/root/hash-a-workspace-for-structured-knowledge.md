How it works
============

Private and secure

Data is private, unless you choose to share it. You can also publish information publicly to the internet.  More

2-way sync

Because data is “typed” it can be synced in and out of the existing apps, tools and databases you already use.  More

Open source

Available under a fully open-source license. No BSL BS, Elastic evasion, or proprietary license headaches.  

Multiplayer

A globally connected knowledge graph. Share and interlink with others.  

Infinite history

View your web as it existed at any point in time, and retrieve old data.  

Provenance assured

See where information came from, who modified it, and how it evolved.  More
