PromptLayer has been a game-changer for us. It has allowed our content team to rapidly iterate on prompts, find the right tone, and address edge cases, all without burdening our engineers. This has been critical for creating an AI that truly connects with and supports our users.

PromptLayer is an example of a company that is solving a different lens of the problem, managing all your different prompts as they come in. The thing that I'm most excited about today is evals… I think it's a fundamental challenge for people using LLMs. When a new model comes out whether it's from OpenAI or some other provider, I don't know as the end user of that model how it's going to impact my use case. And, really, the only way to do that is to have a bunch of robust evals that you go and build…

![Image 169: no-img](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66d5ba3a2306c1a43443cc69/66d6dc013de998072e65b6fe_logankilpatrick.e7946380e738ec282bda.avif)

Getting started with LLM APIs is easy. Moving to production and scale is hard. PromptLayer gives me out-of-the-box tooling to iterate, evaluate, monitor, and multisource my LLM-based apps, so I can spend less time building infrastructure. And just like how Wordpress allowed anyone to publish on the web, PromptLayer empowers non-developers and subject matter experts to iterate and improve on prompts without touching the code.

![Image 171: no-img](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66d5ba3a2306c1a43443cc69/66d6dc042b87891a6ea3f88c_gregBauges.f6ed01685e6f88daf8b2.avif)

### Greg Baugues

Former Director of Developer Relations at Twilio

PromptLayer has become indispensable to our iteration process. Using the Prompt Registry, our team of mental health experts create tests, evaluate responses, and directly make edits to prompts without any engineering support. Even though our team is mostly non-technical, they use PromptLayer to improve the AI based on their personal clinical experience.

The team at PromptLayer has built a seriously impressive platform for prompt engineering. Their prompt CMS does a great job of allowing non-technical stakeholders to actually become the prompt engineers. It's the key that brings analytics, observability, and evals together for easy iteration.

If I'm at my desk and see that somebody's workflow went bad, it takes only 3 or 4 clicks. I go to PromptLayer, filter by the workflow ID, and I'm in. The information density means my time to being productive is really really good.

It takes a lot of work to build a good AI notepad like Granola. Especially because there is no ground-truth to compare against. PromptLayer makes it easy to version and build custom evals for your prompts.
