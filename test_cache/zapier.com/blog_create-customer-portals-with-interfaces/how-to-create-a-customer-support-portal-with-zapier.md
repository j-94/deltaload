# How to create a customer support portal with Zapier


Zapier Interfaces is an excellent way to build customer support portals or resource hubs that connect to thousands of apps, including Zapier Tables, to power your workflows.


## Content

When it comes to customer support, most companies have no shortage of resources.

Whether your team has compiled help documentation and lists of frequently asked questions built forms for your users to submit tickets, chances are they probably live in different places across your website.

That's why it's absolutely vital to have a handy [customer portal](https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-a-customer-portal/) where all of these resources and links can live together under one roof. That way, your customers have an easy way to self-serve or submit tickets to get the support they need.

[Zapier Interfaces](https://interfaces.zapier.com/interfaces), which lets you build custom forms and landing pages, is an excellent way to build this kind of resource hub from scratch. Your forms automatically connect to a  database (via [Zapier Tables](https://zapier.com/blog/zapier-tables-guide/)) and thousands of apps so you can power your business-critical workflows.

In this blog post, I'll walk you through exactly how to create your own customer support portal using Tables and Interfaces—powered by automation.

Step 1: Build your customer support portal in Interfaces
--------------------------------------------------------

Let's start off with creating a customer support portal from one of our pre-made templates.  Click **Try it** on the template below, then click **Use template** in the new window.

![Image 116: Request Portal Template Preview Image](https://zapier.com/blog/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F0sppvm4cmdq7%2F6kbIwNOBstwRaobzo0N0tR%2F56df4ed3b4de8745f2be909b0597763b%2Finterfaces-template-preview-request-portal.png&w=3840&q=75)

Request Portal Template

A simple request portal. Create support tickets and view tickets in a Kanban view.

This will create your page within Interfaces. Your page will include a **Home** layout, which is where you'll set up your portal and all your relevant windows.

Your home page will also include a **Submit Ticket** layout, which is the form you can set up for users to submit tickets to you, and a **View Tickets** layout, which is a Kanban-style board where your submitted tickets will land. You'll also have other layouts to support more resources like a forum, a demo page, and a FAQ page.

![Image 117: Screenshot of pages within your interface](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/7cN6y3fiD6YSLzmIA9GSfo/9f802b17f06ec2730e79fd57d21173eb/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-02.png?w=1400)

If you scroll down, you'll also see that your ticket layout is automatically connected to a table, where those submissions will be saved each time someone submits a ticket. This database is a part of [Zapier Tables](https://tables.zapier.com/app/tables), which allows you to store user tickets and take action on that data effectively.

Under the _Zaps_ section, you'll see any Zaps—what we call Zapier's automated workflows—that are connected to your portal. Whenever you set up this template, Zapier automatically creates a Zap for you. This Zap will send you an automatic email notification whenever someone submits a ticket, so you can easily keep up with user requests.

![Image 118](https://res.cloudinary.com/zapier-media/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1707150316/Blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces6_kcmxvd.png?)

Step 2: Customize your customer support portal
----------------------------------------------

Once you're familiar with the initial layout of your portal, click on your **Home** page.

![Image 119: Screenshot of home page layout in Interfaces](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/tSCZFAEMH92UUcOlrc7D0/dcdf11029ec860e050d03fb8f691afc1/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-03.png?w=1400)

You'll be brought to the backend of your portal, where you can edit each window within your page. The pre-existing template includes four sample link cards (which refer to the portal's layout options) where users can  submit tickets, see FAQs, book demos, and join a forum.

![Image 120: Screenshot of request portal template](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/1V4QiM6X0ZFfnKTZSFbXHy/8f10a5d936f4ea9375ba78bf214ab92d/7.png?w=1400)

In my instance, I'm going to keep it simple and customize these existing link cards so my users can self-serve and report issues autonomously.  But, of course, you can add or remove whichever elements make the most sense for your resource hub.

### Give your portal a title and header copy 

Any support hub or customer portal needs a decent title and header copy so your users know they're in the right place.

To tweak the copy, click **Edit** next to the title.

![Image 121: Screenshot of edit button next to request portal](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/3hiTB4UOZlSunsDSipMEmW/a7128b812a0dd0a821061d9ce6885496/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-04.png?w=1400)

A right-hand side panel called **Content** will appear—this is where you can tweak or add new copy from scratch. Add a personalized header and a descriptive paragraph using [markdown](https://zapier.com/blog/beginner-ultimate-guide-markdown/). Here's what I wrote:

![Image 122: Screenshot of content options in interfaces](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/10NMUkwXrTHjPdO0Uajzz1/eedbca54bc380f76ddd70bb17aa56d7f/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-05.png?w=1400)

Within this panel, you can also adjust parameters like width and text alignment. For my own portal, I'll leave it on the default setting (center).

### Edit your link cards

Once you're happy with the way your header and title look, click back into your portal and click **Edit** next to your layout of link cards.

![Image 123: Screenshot of quick links](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/4QqZJp4Mkf87WyQP9aqPWa/604aab9611ff1936167129c34eb75d38/10.png?w=1400)

Within the right-hand side panel, you can edit the general layout of links, including the header text, the individual links, and the portal's overall width and alignment.

![Image 124: Screenshot of quick links in interfaces](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/7oWICKtyxz6HGGFFbuoyMH/d846a1ee6e3aa744544bebf72c61daf4/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-06.png?w=1400)

First up, click into the **Header** field and add your copy. I'm changing mine to "Resources & support".

![Image 125: Screenshot of resources and support header](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/Ry9cs1VXs1coGXAGrS633/d79c8a682cbf2edbf5a8faec0a069f5e/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-07.png?w=1400)

To edit the text within each link card detail, click on the pencil icon under _Links_.

![Image 126: Screenshot of pencil icon](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/5Dh6hG6pci0UbBTsZNSgPz/d43936f08a6196a10a48ee80a258ad86/13.png?w=1400)

Here you can adjust the layout of each link card, including the title copy, description, link text, URL, emoji, and whether you want to have that link open in a new window.

![Image 127: Screenshot of create ticket link card details](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/5UP0htliTeic0MX9yntbKD/a4ecec60d31ddb9e35e363f20895d80a/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-08.png?w=1400)

Repeat the same process for each individual link card, tailoring your text as you go. The link URLs should be already pre-filled for you, but remember to double-check that these links go where you want them to go.

If you want to add a new link card the template hasn't provided, just click **Add Link** and follow the same process as above.

![Image 128: Screenshot of adding links to link card](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/RIa4eTuetfX1feuREKJTl/e8bf4d7fafcf1b75685790957fdef269/17.png?w=1400)

**Tip:** If you want to rearrange the position of links, just drag and drop each link by grabbing the click-and-drag icon and moving them into the right place.

![Image 129: Screenshot of drag and drop icon in Interfaces](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/2DZC5HY0lw0n0KvIsab3CP/5266e813e54a9894c8e5498e9f5e00fd/18.png?w=1400)

### Edit your ticket submission form

Once you're happy with the look and feel of your link cards, it's time to set up the form for your tickets, which is what your users will see when they want to get in touch. Click on the **Submit Ticket** page on your Interface home page.

![Image 130: Screenshot of submit ticket layout](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/4lOFkIyIDekvQHq3pWeBvp/824e94519087b749f1855957fca36d5b/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-09.png?w=1400)

You'll be brought to the backend of your form, where you can edit the fields so your form says what you want it to say—and looks the way you want it to look. Click **Edit** next to your form fields if you want to adjust the question text or add more.

![Image 131: Screenshot of edit button next to form fields](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/3AYrHeVTw1zdK2AJx1dD9/15fc2bf8a23bbde1e5986a854e9e92c3/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-10.png?w=1400)

Within the right-hand side panel, you can edit your general form fields, including the text for your individual questions, your form's overall width and alignment, and your CTA button text.

![Image 132: Screenshot of form fields editing cards](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/6gGvdUyGAONJW20kQErvwj/811c69ddfa8e777d7112e5f66af21fbd/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-11.png?w=1400)

To edit the text within your questions, click on the pencil icon under _Fields_.

![Image 133: Screenshot of pencil icon in form fields](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/4W6T5XEPPCdelrA3wMjx1T/75c99efd005b5ff5584ab498688847e9/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-12.png?w=1400)

You can add different parameters to each question, including the text, type of text for your replies (like short text, email, long text, etc.), a label, placeholder text, and help text. You can also choose different options for your answers, like requiring a certain answer, hiding it from view, or blocking free email providers.

![Image 134: Screenshot of field settings in Interfaces](https://res.cloudinary.com/zapier-media/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1707150329/Blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces24_hqfitl.png?)

You can also add conditional logic to your form. This allows you to add a condition that determines if a field should be displayed based on previous responses. For example, you might want to display different fields depending on whether the customer has a "billing" issue or a "technical support" issue, so you can continue to gather the most relevant information in an efficient manner.

First up, I've set up a dropdown field that asks whether or not it's a technical, billing, or customer support issue.

![Image 135](https://res.cloudinary.com/zapier-media/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1707150343/Blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces26_fvwajt.png?)

Now, depending on the answer the customer gives, I'll display a different question. So for example, if the customer selects _Technical support,_ I'm going to set up a conditional field that will surface a new question.

![Image 136: Screenshot of conditional logic field setting up](https://res.cloudinary.com/zapier-media/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1707150356/Blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces27_zzgey7.png?)

To add logic to any of your form fields, click the **Logic** tab on the field you want to display to customers after selecting a specific answer:

![Image 137: Screenshot of logic conditions in form fields](https://res.cloudinary.com/zapier-media/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1707150366/Blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces28_rptwqw.png?)

Now let's set up the condition. Click **+Add condition**.

![Image 138: Screenshot of add condition button](https://res.cloudinary.com/zapier-media/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1707150391/Blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces29_a2bfcq.png?)

Next, under _Field_, select the previous question you want to add conditional logic to.

![Image 139: Screenshot of new logic field added to form](https://res.cloudinary.com/zapier-media/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1707150405/Blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces30_dww8ox.png?)

Then, add the condition from the dropdown selection:

![Image 140](https://res.cloudinary.com/zapier-media/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1707150424/Blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces31_gdofai.png?)

Remember to click **Save**. Now, anytime a customer selects technical issue from the dropdown, they'll be presented with another question that breaks down types of technical issues:

![Image 141: Screenshot of a conditionally rendered question in Interfaces forms. ](https://res.cloudinary.com/zapier-media/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1707150438/Blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces32_avhdbt.png?)

You can do this as many times as you like for each dropdown answer.

Once you're happy with your questions, go back into your general form.

If you want to add a new question that's not within the template, just click **Add Field** and follow the same process as above.

Now, if you go to the **Data** tab, you'll see the name of the table that this form is connected to (where your tickets are stored).

![Image 142: Screenshot of linked table](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/1eNWuBeRjdM46uU5QTseO3/379bb3f40275e121d583119b650f4beb/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-13.png?w=1400)

You can also click on **Actions** if you want to see which Zaps are set up with this form. You'll see the Zap that Zapier pre-set up for you, which is the one that sends you an automatic email whenever a person submits a ticket.

![Image 143: Screenshot of actions in Interfaces](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/1jcmKS7hVZfWfVLBrI13lN/462f20af1e5962c24a10d58268f47405/25.png?w=1400)

To build another Zap within your interface, click on **Add action**. You'll be taken to the Zap editor, where you'll see the trigger (form submission created in Interfaces). You can click on the **\+ icon** to add an action step.

For example, you might want to create a ticket in Zendesk automatically whenever someone submits a ticket to you through Interfaces. Like so:

![Image 144: Screenshot of Zap in Zap editor](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/4EbXDoujvhqgp7NPJ0uwyD/f73511dee99c4ac5238571109408d798/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-14.png?w=1400)

Once you've published your Zap, you can navigate back to your Interfaces page under your _Actions_ tab. This is where you'll see your new published Zap. Learn more about adding actions to your form [here](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/15927500577037-Use-forms-in-Zapier-Interfaces#fill-form-fields-in-advance-with-url-parameters-0-2).

### Edit your ticket form's Kanban view

Once you're happy with the way your form looks, it's time to look at the Kanban view of your tickets.

To edit this, click on the **View Tickets** page on your interface's home page.

![Image 145: Screenshot of view tickets layout on interface page](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/1iGdxkPNK2uWctG9ag984b/a09d80fc0addbba1a2337efeab68cbcf/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-15.png?w=1400)

You can use this board to keep track of your tickets from users in one place and track their progress project-management style.

For example, you can share this board with your team and other stakeholders so they can see which tickets are new, which are in progress, and which are completed. To edit the copy or add more progress columns, click **Edit.**

![Image 146: Screenshot of kanban view](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/4WFTas7lOOwCYWLoAgcVmu/c24498d96a87d52559ed0401a3b9bbdd/28.png?w=1400)

In the right-hand panel, you'll be able to edit the text, set user permissions, and set which card details you want to include within the board. That includes adjusting the width and alignment.

![Image 147: Screenshot of content on kanban tickets](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/7dKsBLv6zTZcw3IAmBXmCU/dc88c780d4179dac39a102ffa12a4068/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-16.png?w=1400)

Once you're happy with the way your Kanban board looks, you can head back to your main home page, as your changes will be saved automatically.

### Adjust your settings

Go back to your home page in Interfaces and click on the **Page options** button icon in the top left-hand side of your screen.

![Image 148: Screenshot of page options button](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/6Fljh7aEZZQpe1ISm11Ex4/76ea21fa20024992cce0067c9ec8f9bc/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-17.png?w=1400)

Here you can adjust your page options and personalize the page name, meta title, and URL for your portal.

![Image 149: Screenshot of page options](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/1f9jqEK7ODcPkOUPDu267K/615b0179430a3c56f3383c25f3aa773f/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-18.png?w=1400)

For more advanced settings, click the **Gear** icon in the top-left corner of your page.

![Image 150: Screenshot of settings icon](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/1te2OtSIiEvscZXMeeFfPF/a2bdb906330e42597b78b3829f99998f/create-customer-portal.png?w=1400)

Here you can give your interface a name and change your form's subdomain. This side panel is also where you can adjust your interface's theme (color and branding), insert a custom domain, set user access, or get a tracking ID.

**Note:** To unlock custom branding, set custom domains, and more, you'll need to [upgrade to a premium or advanced account](https://interfaces.zapier.com/pricing) with Interfaces.

Step 3: Test out your portal
----------------------------

Once you've finished setting up your portal, don't forget to test all the links and make sure everything's working correctly. Click on the URL provided in the top-left corner of your interface.

![Image 151: Screenshot of public URL link](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/5h8gJLwfg449374KCBr4dZ/d77b71a39f5005ca757418f1cac9a104/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-19.png?w=1400)

This will take you to the front-end of your portal—what your customers will see. This is my finished portal:

![Image 152: Screenshot of live portal](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/10GBNJHAIqQQTRHNej7czL/4f4bf09a07e3ed5f4967182ee2350b11/34.png?w=1400)

Double-check to make sure all your links are working correctly. It's also a good idea to test out your ticket submission form, so you can see that the replies go where they need to go. Click on your ticket card link and drop in a few test answers to the form.

![Image 153: Screenshot of ticket sample](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/5IxlVQMVarfPK9WhvtHfLO/df9b37cd69b0b8f91314bddb552664c4/35.png?w=1400)

Now, thanks to the Zap that was set up, you should receive an email (the one associated with your Zapier account) to let you know that a customer submitted a ticket. Here's what it will look like:

![Image 154: Screenshot of email sample](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/6ojbbKT5AWPyNVH9WqR4Va/e3f36258e62f919824f19b2a67b56243/36.png?w=1400)

Want to change who receives this email or add more people to the email thread?

To change who gets notified, just go back to your interface and click on the Zap listed under _Zaps_.

![Image 155: Screenshot of Zaps](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/2DaLndLUQOtVptJgJ1DkzU/ecf3bbd64c1869df8f74785ecf8a0465/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-20.png?w=1400)

Your Zap will open in the Zap editor. Click **Edit draft** on the top right.

![Image 156: Screenshot of edit draft](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/4hqj83hJU59wjyOvJa6iWT/54e6332e7759dc3080690bd41e1077ee/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-21.png?w=1400)

Click on the action step. Then inside the _To_ field, you can change the email address or add a list of different email addresses, separated by commas. Here's an example:

![Image 157: Screenshot of zap set up part](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/3f1b6pPtgAUCWAtIoUkbfx/6884830ba550173b065818719dfb60f4/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-22.png?w=1400)

Once you're happy with the way it looks, click **Publish**.

Now, remember you have a table which is linked to your ticket forms. Zapier Tables lets you store each form submission in an automation-powered database, so you can take action on each submission with Zaps.

![Image 158: Screenshot of tables link](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/7GzWtnwpw08zG5tlGXyCAx/fc2fc80e510ece9ed7dac4437a998d75/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-23.png?w=1400)

Once you click on it, you'll be brought to your table, where you should be able to see your test answer.

![Image 159: Screenshot of table layout with test data filled in](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/4zXe4EFSKO6AIFUhU2KiGh/fbdc99fe339ca4af2281fb85184448d1/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-24.png?w=1400)

**Tip:** You can share this table with your team members and anyone else at your company by clicking on **Share** in the top-right corner. To learn more about Zapier Tables, [check out our feature guide](https://zapier.com/blog/zapier-tables-guide/).

If you click on your **View Tickets** tab, you'll also see that the response was sent to your Kanban board under _Todo_.

![Image 160: Screenshot of tickets layout](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/jNaMRUUgIkU8eNRFmDxNv/10404cf6c87836b8e05b317942a44c3c/42.png?w=1400)

Whenever you change the status of an issue, it will automatically be updated in your table and vice versa.

Now that you've built your customer portal using Interfaces, you can share it with the world and start supporting your customers with their needs.

If you've [built an AI chatbot](https://zapier.com/blog/create-custom-ai-chatbots-with-interfaces/) using Interfaces before, you can also add the URL to a link card within your portal, so your users can chat with your AI bot and get the answers they need to support questions.

One of the great things about adding a chatbot component to your form is that you can also connect it to a custom data source (like your company documentation) to tailor your chatbot responses to your business. This is particularly helpful when it comes to customer support.

To add your AI chatbot to your portal, click **Add Link** within your home page.

Then start customizing your link card, the same way we outlined above.

Remember to include the link to your chatbot, which you'll find on your chatbot page in Interfaces. Once you've set this up, remember to click **Done**.

And there you have it, your chatbot will be an available resource within your customer support portal.

  "content": "When it comes to customer support, most companies have no shortage of resources.\n\nWhether your team has compiled help documentation and lists of frequently asked questions built forms for your users to submit tickets, chances are they probably live in different places across your website.\n\nThat's why it's absolutely vital to have a handy [customer portal](https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-a-customer-portal/) where all of these resources and links can live together under one roof. That way, your customers have an easy way to self-serve or submit tickets to get the support they need.\n\n[Zapier Interfaces](https://interfaces.zapier.com/interfaces), which lets you build custom forms and landing pages, is an excellent way to build this kind of resource hub from scratch. Your forms automatically connect to a  database (via [Zapier Tables](https://zapier.com/blog/zapier-tables-guide/)) and thousands of apps so you can power your business-critical workflows.\n\nIn this blog post, I'll walk you through exactly how to create your own customer support portal using Tables and Interfaces—powered by automation.\n\n### Table of contents\n\n*   [Step 1: Build your customer support portal](https://zapier.com/blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/#build)\n    \n*   [Step 2: Customize your customer support portal](https://zapier.com/blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/#customize)\n    \n*   [Step 3: Test out your customer support portal](https://zapier.com/blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/#test)\n    \n\n**New to Zapier?** It's workflow automation software that lets you focus on what matters. Combine user interfaces, data tables, and logic with thousands of apps to build and automate anything you can imagine. [Sign up for free](https://zapier.com/sign-up/).\n\nBefore you begin\n----------------\n\nMake sure you have a Zapier account. You can build your own table today at [tables.zapier.com](https://tables.zapier.com/app/tables?utm_campaign=zpr-gbl-nua-evr-tables_bugs_tutorial-prd&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=zapier). You'll also need access to [Zapier Interfaces](https://zapier.com/blog/zapier-interfaces-guide/), which is where you can build your bug reporting portal. You can start your own portal today at interfaces.zapier.com.\n\n![Image 115: Screenshot of Interfaces home page](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/fgtVo7ICia2YXjxBMTaAk/39757071e15fbf98515d40f92f26da40/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-01.png?w=1400)\n\nStep 1: Build your customer support portal in Interfaces\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet's start off with creating a customer support portal from one of our pre-made templates.  Click **Try it** on the template below, then click **Use template** in the new window.\n\n![Image 116: Request Portal Template Preview Image](https://zapier.com/blog/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F0sppvm4cmdq7%2F6kbIwNOBstwRaobzo0N0tR%2F56df4ed3b4de8745f2be909b0597763b%2Finterfaces-template-preview-request-portal.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nRequest Portal Template\n\nA simple request portal. Create support tickets and view tickets in a Kanban view.\n\nThis will create your page within Interfaces. Your page will include a **Home** layout, which is where you'll set up your portal and all your relevant windows.\n\nYour home page will also include a **Submit Ticket** layout, which is the form you can set up for users to submit tickets to you, and a **View Tickets** layout, which is a Kanban-style board where your submitted tickets will land. You'll also have other layouts to support more resources like a forum, a demo page, and a FAQ page.\n\n![Image 117: Screenshot of pages within your interface](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/7cN6y3fiD6YSLzmIA9GSfo/9f802b17f06ec2730e79fd57d21173eb/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-02.png?w=1400)\n\nIf you scroll down, you'll also see that your ticket layout is automatically connected to a table, where those submissions will be saved each time someone submits a ticket. This database is a part of [Zapier Tables](https://tables.zapier.com/app/tables), which allows you to store user tickets and take action on that data effectively.\n\nUnder the _Zaps_ section, you'll see any Zaps—what we call Zapier's automated workflows—that are connected to your portal. Whenever you set up this template, Zapier automatically creates a Zap for you. This Zap will send you an automatic email notification whenever someone submits a ticket, so you can easily keep up with user requests.\n\n![Image 118](https://res.cloudinary.com/zapier-media/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1707150316/Blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces6_kcmxvd.png?)\n\nStep 2: Customize your customer support portal\n----------------------------------------------\n\nOnce you're familiar with the initial layout of your portal, click on your **Home** page.\n\n![Image 119: Screenshot of home page layout in Interfaces](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/tSCZFAEMH92UUcOlrc7D0/dcdf11029ec860e050d03fb8f691afc1/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-03.png?w=1400)\n\nYou'll be brought to the backend of your portal, where you can edit each window within your page. The pre-existing template includes four sample link cards (which refer to the portal's layout options) where users can  submit tickets, see FAQs, book demos, and join a forum.\n\n![Image 120: Screenshot of request portal template](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/1V4QiM6X0ZFfnKTZSFbXHy/8f10a5d936f4ea9375ba78bf214ab92d/7.png?w=1400)\n\nIn my instance, I'm going to keep it simple and customize these existing link cards so my users can self-serve and report issues autonomously.  But, of course, you can add or remove whichever elements make the most sense for your resource hub.\n\n### Give your portal a title and header copy \n\nAny support hub or customer portal needs a decent title and header copy so your users know they're in the right place.\n\nTo tweak the copy, click **Edit** next to the title.\n\n![Image 121: Screenshot of edit button next to request portal](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/3hiTB4UOZlSunsDSipMEmW/a7128b812a0dd0a821061d9ce6885496/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-04.png?w=1400)\n\nA right-hand side panel called **Content** will appear—this is where you can tweak or add new copy from scratch. Add a personalized header and a descriptive paragraph using [markdown](https://zapier.com/blog/beginner-ultimate-guide-markdown/). Here's what I wrote:\n\n![Image 122: Screenshot of content options in interfaces](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/10NMUkwXrTHjPdO0Uajzz1/eedbca54bc380f76ddd70bb17aa56d7f/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-05.png?w=1400)\n\nWithin this panel, you can also adjust parameters like width and text alignment. For my own portal, I'll leave it on the default setting (center).\n\n### Edit your link cards\n\nOnce you're happy with the way your header and title look, click back into your portal and click **Edit** next to your layout of link cards.\n\n![Image 123: Screenshot of quick links](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/4QqZJp4Mkf87WyQP9aqPWa/604aab9611ff1936167129c34eb75d38/10.png?w=1400)\n\nWithin the right-hand side panel, you can edit the general layout of links, including the header text, the individual links, and the portal's overall width and alignment.\n\n![Image 124: Screenshot of quick links in interfaces](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/7oWICKtyxz6HGGFFbuoyMH/d846a1ee6e3aa744544bebf72c61daf4/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-06.png?w=1400)\n\nFirst up, click into the **Header** field and add your copy. I'm changing mine to \"Resources & support\".\n\n![Image 125: Screenshot of resources and support header](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/Ry9cs1VXs1coGXAGrS633/d79c8a682cbf2edbf5a8faec0a069f5e/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-07.png?w=1400)\n\nTo edit the text within each link card detail, click on the pencil icon under _Links_.\n\n![Image 126: Screenshot of pencil icon](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/5Dh6hG6pci0UbBTsZNSgPz/d43936f08a6196a10a48ee80a258ad86/13.png?w=1400)\n\nHere you can adjust the layout of each link card, including the title copy, description, link text, URL, emoji, and whether you want to have that link open in a new window.\n\n![Image 127: Screenshot of create ticket link card details](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/5UP0htliTeic0MX9yntbKD/a4ecec60d31ddb9e35e363f20895d80a/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-08.png?w=1400)\n\nRepeat the same process for each individual link card, tailoring your text as you go. The link URLs should be already pre-filled for you, but remember to double-check that these links go where you want them to go.\n\nIf you want to add a new link card the template hasn't provided, just click **Add Link** and follow the same process as above.\n\n![Image 128: Screenshot of adding links to link card](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/RIa4eTuetfX1feuREKJTl/e8bf4d7fafcf1b75685790957fdef269/17.png?w=1400)\n\n**Tip:** If you want to rearrange the position of links, just drag and drop each link by grabbing the click-and-drag icon and moving them into the right place.\n\n![Image 129: Screenshot of drag and drop icon in Interfaces](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/2DZC5HY0lw0n0KvIsab3CP/5266e813e54a9894c8e5498e9f5e00fd/18.png?w=1400)\n\n### Edit your ticket submission form\n\nOnce you're happy with the look and feel of your link cards, it's time to set up the form for your tickets, which is what your users will see when they want to get in touch. Click on the **Submit Ticket** page on your Interface home page.\n\n![Image 130: Screenshot of submit ticket layout](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/4lOFkIyIDekvQHq3pWeBvp/824e94519087b749f1855957fca36d5b/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-09.png?w=1400)\n\nYou'll be brought to the backend of your form, where you can edit the fields so your form says what you want it to say—and looks the way you want it to look. Click **Edit** next to your form fields if you want to adjust the question text or add more.\n\n![Image 131: Screenshot of edit button next to form fields](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/3AYrHeVTw1zdK2AJx1dD9/15fc2bf8a23bbde1e5986a854e9e92c3/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-10.png?w=1400)\n\nWithin the right-hand side panel, you can edit your general form fields, including the text for your individual questions, your form's overall width and alignment, and your CTA button text.\n\n![Image 132: Screenshot of form fields editing cards](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/6gGvdUyGAONJW20kQErvwj/811c69ddfa8e777d7112e5f66af21fbd/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-11.png?w=1400)\n\nTo edit the text within your questions, click on the pencil icon under _Fields_.\n\n![Image 133: Screenshot of pencil icon in form fields](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/4W6T5XEPPCdelrA3wMjx1T/75c99efd005b5ff5584ab498688847e9/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-12.png?w=1400)\n\nYou can add different parameters to each question, including the text, type of text for your replies (like short text, email, long text, etc.), a label, placeholder text, and help text. You can also choose different options for your answers, like requiring a certain answer, hiding it from view, or blocking free email providers.\n\n![Image 134: Screenshot of field settings in Interfaces](https://res.cloudinary.com/zapier-media/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1707150329/Blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces24_hqfitl.png?)\n\nYou can also add conditional logic to your form. This allows you to add a condition that determines if a field should be displayed based on previous responses. For example, you might want to display different fields depending on whether the customer has a \"billing\" issue or a \"technical support\" issue, so you can continue to gather the most relevant information in an efficient manner.\n\nFirst up, I've set up a dropdown field that asks whether or not it's a technical, billing, or customer support issue.\n\n![Image 135](https://res.cloudinary.com/zapier-media/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1707150343/Blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces26_fvwajt.png?)\n\nNow, depending on the answer the customer gives, I'll display a different question. So for example, if the customer selects _Technical support,_ I'm going to set up a conditional field that will surface a new question.\n\n![Image 136: Screenshot of conditional logic field setting up](https://res.cloudinary.com/zapier-media/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1707150356/Blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces27_zzgey7.png?)\n\nTo add logic to any of your form fields, click the **Logic** tab on the field you want to display to customers after selecting a specific answer:\n\n![Image 137: Screenshot of logic conditions in form fields](https://res.cloudinary.com/zapier-media/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1707150366/Blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces28_rptwqw.png?)\n\nNow let's set up the condition. Click **+Add condition**.\n\n![Image 138: Screenshot of add condition button](https://res.cloudinary.com/zapier-media/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1707150391/Blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces29_a2bfcq.png?)\n\nNext, under _Field_, select the previous question you want to add conditional logic to.\n\n![Image 139: Screenshot of new logic field added to form](https://res.cloudinary.com/zapier-media/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1707150405/Blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces30_dww8ox.png?)\n\nThen, add the condition from the dropdown selection:\n\n![Image 140](https://res.cloudinary.com/zapier-media/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1707150424/Blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces31_gdofai.png?)\n\nRemember to click **Save**. Now, anytime a customer selects technical issue from the dropdown, they'll be presented with another question that breaks down types of technical issues:\n\n![Image 141: Screenshot of a conditionally rendered question in Interfaces forms. ](https://res.cloudinary.com/zapier-media/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1707150438/Blog/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces32_avhdbt.png?)\n\nYou can do this as many times as you like for each dropdown answer.\n\nOnce you're happy with your questions, go back into your general form.\n\nIf you want to add a new question that's not within the template, just click **Add Field** and follow the same process as above.\n\nNow, if you go to the **Data** tab, you'll see the name of the table that this form is connected to (where your tickets are stored).\n\n![Image 142: Screenshot of linked table](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/1eNWuBeRjdM46uU5QTseO3/379bb3f40275e121d583119b650f4beb/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-13.png?w=1400)\n\nYou can also click on **Actions** if you want to see which Zaps are set up with this form. You'll see the Zap that Zapier pre-set up for you, which is the one that sends you an automatic email whenever a person submits a ticket.\n\n![Image 143: Screenshot of actions in Interfaces](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/1jcmKS7hVZfWfVLBrI13lN/462f20af1e5962c24a10d58268f47405/25.png?w=1400)\n\nTo build another Zap within your interface, click on **Add action**. You'll be taken to the Zap editor, where you'll see the trigger (form submission created in Interfaces). You can click on the **\\+ icon** to add an action step.\n\nFor example, you might want to create a ticket in Zendesk automatically whenever someone submits a ticket to you through Interfaces. Like so:\n\n![Image 144: Screenshot of Zap in Zap editor](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/4EbXDoujvhqgp7NPJ0uwyD/f73511dee99c4ac5238571109408d798/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-14.png?w=1400)\n\nOnce you've published your Zap, you can navigate back to your Interfaces page under your _Actions_ tab. This is where you'll see your new published Zap. Learn more about adding actions to your form [here](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/15927500577037-Use-forms-in-Zapier-Interfaces#fill-form-fields-in-advance-with-url-parameters-0-2).\n\n### Edit your ticket form's Kanban view\n\nOnce you're happy with the way your form looks, it's time to look at the Kanban view of your tickets.\n\nTo edit this, click on the **View Tickets** page on your interface's home page.\n\n![Image 145: Screenshot of view tickets layout on interface page](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/1iGdxkPNK2uWctG9ag984b/a09d80fc0addbba1a2337efeab68cbcf/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-15.png?w=1400)\n\nYou can use this board to keep track of your tickets from users in one place and track their progress project-management style.\n\nFor example, you can share this board with your team and other stakeholders so they can see which tickets are new, which are in progress, and which are completed. To edit the copy or add more progress columns, click **Edit.**\n\n![Image 146: Screenshot of kanban view](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/4WFTas7lOOwCYWLoAgcVmu/c24498d96a87d52559ed0401a3b9bbdd/28.png?w=1400)\n\nIn the right-hand panel, you'll be able to edit the text, set user permissions, and set which card details you want to include within the board. That includes adjusting the width and alignment.\n\n![Image 147: Screenshot of content on kanban tickets](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/7dKsBLv6zTZcw3IAmBXmCU/dc88c780d4179dac39a102ffa12a4068/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-16.png?w=1400)\n\nOnce you're happy with the way your Kanban board looks, you can head back to your main home page, as your changes will be saved automatically.\n\n### Adjust your settings\n\nGo back to your home page in Interfaces and click on the **Page options** button icon in the top left-hand side of your screen.\n\n![Image 148: Screenshot of page options button](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/6Fljh7aEZZQpe1ISm11Ex4/76ea21fa20024992cce0067c9ec8f9bc/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-17.png?w=1400)\n\nHere you can adjust your page options and personalize the page name, meta title, and URL for your portal.\n\n![Image 149: Screenshot of page options](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/1f9jqEK7ODcPkOUPDu267K/615b0179430a3c56f3383c25f3aa773f/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-18.png?w=1400)\n\nFor more advanced settings, click the **Gear** icon in the top-left corner of your page.\n\n![Image 150: Screenshot of settings icon](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/1te2OtSIiEvscZXMeeFfPF/a2bdb906330e42597b78b3829f99998f/create-customer-portal.png?w=1400)\n\nHere you can give your interface a name and change your form's subdomain. This side panel is also where you can adjust your interface's theme (color and branding), insert a custom domain, set user access, or get a tracking ID.\n\n**Note:** To unlock custom branding, set custom domains, and more, you'll need to [upgrade to a premium or advanced account](https://interfaces.zapier.com/pricing) with Interfaces.\n\nStep 3: Test out your portal\n----------------------------\n\nOnce you've finished setting up your portal, don't forget to test all the links and make sure everything's working correctly. Click on the URL provided in the top-left corner of your interface.\n\n![Image 151: Screenshot of public URL link](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/5h8gJLwfg449374KCBr4dZ/d77b71a39f5005ca757418f1cac9a104/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-19.png?w=1400)\n\nThis will take you to the front-end of your portal—what your customers will see. This is my finished portal:\n\n![Image 152: Screenshot of live portal](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/10GBNJHAIqQQTRHNej7czL/4f4bf09a07e3ed5f4967182ee2350b11/34.png?w=1400)\n\nDouble-check to make sure all your links are working correctly. It's also a good idea to test out your ticket submission form, so you can see that the replies go where they need to go. Click on your ticket card link and drop in a few test answers to the form.\n\n![Image 153: Screenshot of ticket sample](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/5IxlVQMVarfPK9WhvtHfLO/df9b37cd69b0b8f91314bddb552664c4/35.png?w=1400)\n\nNow, thanks to the Zap that was set up, you should receive an email (the one associated with your Zapier account) to let you know that a customer submitted a ticket. Here's what it will look like:\n\n![Image 154: Screenshot of email sample](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/6ojbbKT5AWPyNVH9WqR4Va/e3f36258e62f919824f19b2a67b56243/36.png?w=1400)\n\nWant to change who receives this email or add more people to the email thread?\n\nTo change who gets notified, just go back to your interface and click on the Zap listed under _Zaps_.\n\n![Image 155: Screenshot of Zaps](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/2DaLndLUQOtVptJgJ1DkzU/ecf3bbd64c1869df8f74785ecf8a0465/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-20.png?w=1400)\n\nYour Zap will open in the Zap editor. Click **Edit draft** on the top right.\n\n![Image 156: Screenshot of edit draft](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/4hqj83hJU59wjyOvJa6iWT/54e6332e7759dc3080690bd41e1077ee/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-21.png?w=1400)\n\nClick on the action step. Then inside the _To_ field, you can change the email address or add a list of different email addresses, separated by commas. Here's an example:\n\n![Image 157: Screenshot of zap set up part](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/3f1b6pPtgAUCWAtIoUkbfx/6884830ba550173b065818719dfb60f4/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-22.png?w=1400)\n\nOnce you're happy with the way it looks, click **Publish**.\n\nNow, remember you have a table which is linked to your ticket forms. Zapier Tables lets you store each form submission in an automation-powered database, so you can take action on each submission with Zaps.\n\n![Image 158: Screenshot of tables link](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/7GzWtnwpw08zG5tlGXyCAx/fc2fc80e510ece9ed7dac4437a998d75/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-23.png?w=1400)\n\nOnce you click on it, you'll be brought to your table, where you should be able to see your test answer.\n\n![Image 159: Screenshot of table layout with test data filled in](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/4zXe4EFSKO6AIFUhU2KiGh/fbdc99fe339ca4af2281fb85184448d1/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-24.png?w=1400)\n\n**Tip:** You can share this table with your team members and anyone else at your company by clicking on **Share** in the top-right corner. To learn more about Zapier Tables, [check out our feature guide](https://zapier.com/blog/zapier-tables-guide/).\n\nIf you click on your **View Tickets** tab, you'll also see that the response was sent to your Kanban board under _Todo_.\n\n![Image 160: Screenshot of tickets layout](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/jNaMRUUgIkU8eNRFmDxNv/10404cf6c87836b8e05b317942a44c3c/42.png?w=1400)\n\nWhenever you change the status of an issue, it will automatically be updated in your table and vice versa.\n\nNow that you've built your customer portal using Interfaces, you can share it with the world and start supporting your customers with their needs.\n\nTip: Add an AI chatbot to your customer portal\n----------------------------------------------\n\nIf you've [built an AI chatbot](https://zapier.com/blog/create-custom-ai-chatbots-with-interfaces/) using Interfaces before, you can also add the URL to a link card within your portal, so your users can chat with your AI bot and get the answers they need to support questions.\n\nOne of the great things about adding a chatbot component to your form is that you can also connect it to a custom data source (like your company documentation) to tailor your chatbot responses to your business. This is particularly helpful when it comes to customer support.\n\nTo add your AI chatbot to your portal, click **Add Link** within your home page.\n\n![Image 161: Screenshot of adding new link cards](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/2QL4C1H12uWngUqCCCCh9n/ffc3d3313d73d7b2bf09f05598664e29/43.png?w=1400)\n\nThen start customizing your link card, the same way we outlined above.\n\n![Image 162: Screenshot of AI chatbot link card](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/wPoXlWtJTrDRq52mhJGSf/1e45add1b9e6f854d1b281ff12def5ec/create-customer-portals-with-interfaces-25.png?w=1400)\n\nRemember to include the link to your chatbot, which you'll find on your chatbot page in Interfaces. Once you've set this up, remember to click **Done**.\n\nAnd there you have it, your chatbot will be an available resource within your customer support portal.\n\n![Image 163: Screenshot of finished AI chatbot](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/3tJayATzETsMlIQImOSXtN/b27da098d8e9fb1ea78a821534ff5fef/45.png?w=1400)\n\nIf you haven't built an AI chatbot before, don't worry, it's easy!
