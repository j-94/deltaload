Robust and modular LLM prompting using **types, templates, constraints and an optimizing runtime.**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

lmql

```
@lmql.query
def meaning_of_life():
    '''lmql
    # top-level strings are prompts
    "Q: What is the answer to life, the \
     universe and everything?"

    # generation via (constrained) variables
    "A: [ANSWER]" where \
        len(ANSWER) < 120 and STOPS_AT(ANSWER, ".")

    # results are directly accessible
    print("LLM returned", ANSWER)

    # use typed variables for guaranteed 
    # output format
    "The answer is [NUM: int]"

    # query programs are just functions 
    return NUM
    '''

# so from Python, you can just do this
meaning_of_life() # 42
```

Nested Queries bring Procedural Programming to Prompting NEW
------------------------------------------------------------

LMQL now supports nested queries, enabling modularized local instructions and re-use of prompt components.

Works Across Backends
---------------------

LMQL automatically makes your LLM code portable across several backends. You can switch between them with a single line of code.

------------

Prompt construction and generation is implemented via expressive _Python control flow and string interpolation_.

lmql

```
# top level strings are prompts
"My packing list for the trip:"

# use loops for repeated prompts
for i in range(4):
    # 'where' denotes hard constraints enforced by the runtime
    "- [THING] \n" where THING in \ 
        ["Volleyball", "Sunscreen", "Bathing Suit"]
```
