### OUR VISION

Agents is the next step toward evolving automation for the AI age.

Over a decade ago, Zapier launched with a simple idea that computers should do more work for you.

Today, over 2.2 million businesses use Zapier to automate 2 billion tasks every month.

Agents puts you in the driver's seat to automate even more work with the help of your friendly AI agents.

With Agents, your task is as good as done
-----------------------------------------

What makes Agents magical?
--------------------------

### Live data

Ask agents about the data in your apps. Data sources sync automatically.

### AI automation

Add behaviors so your agent can work at any hour, whether you’re there or not.

### 7,000+ apps

Agents runs on Zapier's ecosystem to help you automate the tools you already use.

### One AI workspace

The best of AI chat, automation, and data analysis—all in one place.

Chat with live data from your apps
----------------------------------

Connect your source of truth to Agents, so agents have the knowledge they need to get the job done. Agents automatically sync with your latest data.

### Query your data

Know in an instant. Ask agents to search and analyze data from a spreadsheet. Get answers about customer sentiment, order volume, or untapped leads.

### Follow up

Nudge things toward a resolution, automatically. Remind teams about deadlines, customers about invoices, or leads about offers. You can even teach your agent to stick to a script.

### Learn about leads

Teach agents to get background on new leads and keep you up-to-date. Enrich your leads, search the data, and act on it in a single workspace.

### Draft responses

Let your agent recommend the first reply using your style. Queue up messages for customer support, team communications, or consulting requests.

New to AI? You’re not alone.
----------------------------

Here are some answers to common questions we get about how AI works

How do I improve the reliability of AI agents?
----------------------------------------------

Follow a few of our [tips for writing an effective AI prompt](https://zapier.com/blog/ai-prompt/): include helpful information upfront, give examples, define the expected formats length of response, and give agents a role.

What is an activity?
--------------------

Every time your agent runs a behavior or instant action, we count that as an activity. Each run counts as one activity, no matter how many steps you use in the run. You can run up to 400 activities per month on a free plan, or up to 1,500  on a Premium plan. [If you need more activities, let's talk](https://central.zapier.app/sales).

Why don’t I get the same outcome from AI every time?
----------------------------------------------------

That’s because of non-determinism. That’s the fancy term describing why AI agents will reply with different, but likely similar, answers to the same question. It’s a feature that’s core to Large Language Models (LLMs), and what makes LLMs different from computers, which will do the same thing every single time. It’s not a bug, it’s a feature!

How are activities counted for Zapier Team accounts?
----------------------------------------------------

If you have a Team account on Zapier, your team shares a pool of Agents activities. For example, if you upgrade to a Premium plan for Agents, you can run up to 1,500 activities across all the agents your team creates.

What app actions can agents perform on my behalf
------------------------------------------------

Agents can only take actions in the apps you’ve connected and use the triggers and actions you’ve set up. When configuring a behavior trigger or action field in Agents, you have the option to have the agent always use the same value, pick from a specific set of values, have it guess the value, or not set any value. To provide additional control, you can add more details to your behavior instructions.

Can I use Agents with my Zapier Enterprise account?
---------------------------------------------------

Not out of the box. Agents doesn't currently support app and action restrictions that may be in place on an Enterprise account. If you’re on an Enterprise plan and would like to use Agents, please [reach out to us](https://central.zapier.app/contact-us).
