Secure and reliable

We use industry-standard best practices to keep your data private and secure. We **never** use your data to train models.

Every piece of data transmitted, stored, or processed through our platform is shielded by 256-bit AES encryption.

Scoped API keys let you restrict access to specific endpoints and knowledge bases for more fine-grained control over data access.

When the OpenAI API goes down, we automatically switch over to equivalent models from Anthropic.
