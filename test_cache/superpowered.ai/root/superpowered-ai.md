From marketing tools for financial advisors to workflow automations for accountants, our customers are building all kinds of innovative SaaS products with our platform.

Writing books

Our Long-Form endpoint can write an entire chapter in one go, letting you write an entire book in days instead of months.

Building non-profit legal aid tools

Non-profits are using Superpowered to provide free legal aid to people in need, in a way that isn’t possible without AI.

Secure and reliable

We use industry-standard best practices to keep your data private and secure. We **never** use your data to train models.

Every piece of data transmitted, stored, or processed through our platform is shielded by 256-bit AES encryption.

Scoped API keys let you restrict access to specific endpoints and knowledge bases for more fine-grained control over data access.

When the OpenAI API goes down, we automatically switch over to equivalent models from Anthropic.

Trusted by 10,000+ users
