Robust LLM driven development.
------------------------------

Plandex helps engineers use generative AI productively in serious projects.  
Build entire features and apps with a sustainable, git-inspired workflow.

### Context Management

Add files or directories to context in the terminal. Keep them updated automatically. Maintain precise control.

### Long-Running Agents

Use long-running agents to plan out and implement tasks that are too large for ChatGPT or IDE-based tools.

### Review and Revise

Proposed changes are acumulated in a version-controlled sandbox. Review and iterate before applying.

### Easy Install

No messing around with Python versions or virtual environments. Installs in seconds and runs anywhere.

Add files or directories to context in the terminal. Keep them updated automatically. Maintain precise control.

Find the sweet spot for autonomous coding.
------------------------------------------

LLMs offer impressive productivity gains for many kinds of tasks. They also have serious limitations and need a LOT of guidance. The key to using them effectively is striking the right balance between AI autonomy and developer control.

### Pragmatism Over Hype

No tire-spinning or wasted tokens.

We're looking forward to the day that AI models can go from idea to production-ready app with no human involvement, and we're trying to bring that day closer. In the meantime, Plandex tries to enable the optimal collaboration between developer and AI. It focuses on the areas that AI can add the most value, deferring to you on the rest.

### Automatic Syntax Checking

Auto-fix syntax in 30+ languages.

Plandex automatically checks for valid syntax and can auto-fix its own mistakes, improving reliability. Apart from syntax issues, Plandex also attempts to fix other problems like incorrectly removed code, missing imports, missing variable declarations, missing function implementations, and more.

### Precise Context Management

Know exactly what's in context.

Giving the LLM access to relevant context is crucial to getting good results, especially when working on a large task in an existing project. Unlike IDE-based tools that tend to make it hard to know exactly what's in context or whether it's up-to-date, Plandex gives the developer full control and transparency.

### Keep Errors Out Of Code

A versioned sandbox for the LLM.

Plandex gives the LLM its own version-controlled sandbox where proposed changes accumulate, making it easy to review changes before applying them. You can also work in parallel with the model without your changes and the model's changes becoming intertwined. As a result, mistakes and hallucinations don't make it into your code.

### Recover From Bad Output

Tools for getting back on track.

If you aren't happy with the results, Plandex makes it easy to try a different direction. You can rewind to exactly where things went wrong, add context or update the prompt, and try again. If updates are applied incorrectly to a file, you can reject those changes and apply them manually.

### Iterate Alongside AI

The power of a tight feedback loop.

Apart from separating the LLM's changes from yours, Plandex keeps all files in context up to date automatically. When you make changes and then send another prompt, the LLM will use the latest state of your code. This enables a tight feedback loop between the developer and the model.

Plandex for **teams.**
----------------------

Interested in using Plandex with your team? While you can [do this already](https://docs.plandex.ai/core-concepts/orgs) in a basic way, we plan to build sharing, collaboration, SSO, and role-based authorization features that will help engineering teams work effectively with LLMs.

We're looking for design partners to help us shape these features and find our way to the ideal AI-driven development workflow for teams. If that sounds like you, drop your info below and we'll be in touch.
