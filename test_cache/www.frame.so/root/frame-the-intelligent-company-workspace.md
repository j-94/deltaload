It’s legit. Everything in one spot, no more tab chaos. Those AI suggestions? They're like that friend who always has the best advice. And starting a project with their templates? Feels like a breeze.

I've eagerly awaited this launch and am as excited about Frame as I was about Figma/Canva or ChatGPT. Congratulations on your launch!

I love this product as it solves two main issues with our previous product stack: too many products and too much bloat in each product.

This looks really cool and helpful. I love the blend of having your own essential apps (notes, whiteboard, project tracker etc.) as well as shortcuts to access the specialized ones like JIRA and AirTable as it is harder to move away from them! It would be awesome if you could add Figma in there as well.

Frame provides you with just what you need when you need it. If you are tired to switch between multiple apps to do your job, Frame solves this with the simplest UX and most powerful productivity I have tried for ever.
