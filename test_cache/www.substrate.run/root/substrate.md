Infrastructure for _intelligent software._
==========================================

Substrate is the platform for agentic AI. Elegant abstractions. High-performance components: optimized models, vector database, code interpreter, model router. And the only compute engine optimized for multi-step AI workloads.

Simple abstractions _that run fast._
====================================

Substrate is the only compute engine designed to run multi-step AI workloads.

Describe your task by connecting components — and let Substrate run it as fast as possible.

[Automatic workload tuning](https://www.substrate.run/#automatic-workload-tuning)[Maximum parallelism](https://www.substrate.run/#maximum-parallelism)[Fewer roundtrips](https://www.substrate.run/#fewer-roundtrips)

We analyze your workload as a **directed acyclic graph** and optimize the graph — for example, merging nodes that can be run in a batch.

#### Your code

#### Optimized workflow

Unified platform_to build fast._
================================

Substrate provides simple abstractions for building compound AI systems, making it easy to create workflows by connecting modular building blocks called [nodes](https://www.substrate.run/nodes).

Simple abstractions for compound AI
-----------------------------------

Substrate introduces simple, intuitive abstractions for building compound AI systems, making it easy to create complex workflows by connecting modular building blocks called [nodes](https://www.substrate.run/nodes).

```python
# pip install substrate
from substrate import Substrate, ComputeText, sb

s = Substrate(api_key="SUBSTRATE_API_KEY")

topic1 = "a magical forest"
topic2 = "a futuristic city"

story1 = ComputeText(prompt=f"Tell me a story about {topic1}")
story2 = ComputeText(prompt=f"Tell me a story about {topic2}")
summary = ComputeText(prompt=sb.format(
  "Summarize these stories:\nStory 1: {story1}\nStory 2: {story2}",
  story1=story1.future.text,
  story2=story2.future.text)
)

response = s.run(summary)
```

===============

*   > I **LOVE this API** paradigm.
    
*   > Finally, a **principled agent framework**.
    
*   > Your speeds are **blazing fast** rn.
    
*   > Sooo clean, kind of **makes LangChain look bloated**.
    
*   > I’m here because I checked out the SDK and really liked the abstraction choices.

    > 
    > Very excited for others to start to see and understand how amazing this product is.
    
*   > Love it – was using a version of this internally, but this implementation is sick. **Bullish on Substrate**!
    
*   > Discovered Substrate. It’s **really cool and useful**.
    
*   > This is the first agents platform that’s **very first principle** IMO.
    
*   > I will tell you that at the very minimum **you’ve gained a customer** in me that will show other people this platform.
    
*   > I’ve been testing your API, it’s **really amazing**. And **FAST**!

    > Substrate is the developer experience I always wanted. We tried LangChain, Pinecone, various inference APIs… Now we just use Substrate.
    
*   > I’ve been looking for a **replacement to Hugging Face and OpenAI API** for years. Glad I found ya.
    
*   > Just wanted to say Substrate looks very cool. Your demos make it look **soooo easy**.
    
*   > So, I finally got to check out Substrate, and I must admit it’s **damn interesting**.
    
*   > Love the futures concept \[…\] **absolutely love it**.
    
*   > Having a ‘**this is a product we ought to use**’ moment.
    
*   > Love the naming conventions. \[…\] Love seeing fellow ex-Stripes build new companies.
    
*   > I’m annoyed I haven’t been recommending your product to my clients in my independent AI consulting work, because **it is awesome**.
    
*   > A **proper abstraction** makes development **feel natural**, and honestly, **joyful** too.
